m_arrNarrativeStrings[0]="Having survived the alien assault on XCOM HQ, a broken-down Central Officer Bradford has been living in the fringes since that harrowing day. Now a year or so later, Central has fallen in with a few hardy souls doing what they can to survive the spreading alien occupation. Spurred on by the thought of finding any remnants of his beloved XCOM, Central sets off with his new friends following a map of unknown origin."
m_arrNarrativeStrings[1]="Before his rise to infamy with the Resistance Radio network, the DJ made several attempts at building a fledging radio network of his own. Piecing together a series of jerry-rigged transmitters and relays hidden near coastal towns on the fringes of ADVENT territory, the DJ piggybacked his transmission using stolen alien technology. The signal reached far and wide, but unbeknownst to him, it caught the attention of more than just ADVENT. Now it's up to Central and friends to clean up the mess and discover what lurks beneath the sea."
m_arrNarrativeStrings[2]="Although the Avenger is still far from being flight-ready, the ship has already become something of a hub for the early resistance movement. With both a professional and personal connection to the Avenger, Lily Shen has taken on the role of \"facilitator,\" gathering resources and supplies to keep the ship in top condition until the day finally comes when she can fly again."
m_arrNarrativeStrings[3]="As word of a growing resistance movement spreads, the Elders are increasingly desperate to find the still-grounded Avenger. During one of her field excursions, Shen is captured by a special unit of ADVENT soldiers assembled solely to hunt the Avenger. During her time in captivity, Shen learns that this ADVENT team has been taking prisoners from among the various resistance cells for some time. It's up to Central and the resurgent XCOM to save these future heroes of the resistance before it's too late."

; I am adding tactical text here for the alien units. This would show in the MP unit picker, similar to what we had in EU.

; Sectoid: "<Bullet/> The Sectoid is tougher and more Psionically powerful than its previous incarnation\n<Bullet/> Mindspin can have a variety of effects; the more potent effects are more likely against targets with low Will\n<Bullet/> The Sectoid also causes a damaging, but not destructive, Psionic explosion one turn after dying\n<Bullet/> One vulnerability is that the Sectoid takes extra damage from melee attacks; keep your Sectoids far away from enemy close combat units"
; Viper: "<Bullet/> Vipers are versatile, dangerous units with a variety of unique combat capabilities\n<Bullet/> They can use their tongues to pull enemies towards them, including from cover locations\n<Bullet/> Once adjacent, they can constrict enemies to death, making them extremely dangerous against isolated targets\n<Bullet/> They can also debuff and damage groups of enemies by spitting poison in an area\n<Bullet/> They are fragile, although their Dodge capability can allow them to survive a big hit"
; Muton: "<Bullet/> Mutons are more dangerous than ever - tough, and able to deal significant damage\n<Bullet/> Unlike the Mutons of the invasion era, the new hybridized Mutons are highly effective at close combat\n<Bullet/> Their Counterattack ability permits them to take a return attack at anyone who engages them in melee\n<Bullet/> They can also Execute incapacitated nearby enemies; under no circumstances should you allow an enemy Muton near one of your stunned units\n<Bullet/> They can also Suppress with their rifles, and their battle armor provides consistent protection"
; Chryssalid: "<Bullet/> Chryssalids are highly mobile aliens than can reproduce on the battlefield\n<Bullet/> They can burrow into the ground to conceal themselves from the enemy, and launch themselves at enemies who tread too close\n<Bullet/> Their parthenogenic poison, transmitted through a killing blow, causes the target to become enveloped in a cocoon. Shortly thereafter the cocoon will burst into multiple new Chryssalids\n<Bullet/> Chryssalids' main weakness is their lack of any ranged attacks"
; Andromedon: "<Bullet/> Andromedons are frail, mysterious aliens that inhabit hulking robotic Battlesuits\n<Bullet/> They have enormous staying power, and can batter their way through walls and other blocking terrain\n<Bullet/> They can also deploy acid grenades, which do damage and make affected enemies more vulnerable to incoming damage\n<Bullet/> When an Andromedon dies, its Battlesuit will continue to fight until it is killed separately - but without the benefit of ranged attacks\n<bullet/> It will also leak acid nearby, making it even more dangerous in close quarters"
; Berserker: "<Bullet/> Female Mutons who distinguish themselves above all others in combat undergo treatment to become Berserkers\n<Bullet/> They can combine movement and devastating melee attacks\n<Bullet/> As they take damage, they can become Enraged and even Psychotic, which grants a chance for bonus actions every turn\n<Bullet/> Once a Muton has triumphed in many battles as a Berserker, she is eligible to assume her place among the Mutons' tribal leadership"
; Faceless: "<Bullet/> These mysterious, protean aliens are capable of altering the apparent body mass and assuming the physical forms of other organisms\n<Bullet/> On Earth they assume the form of human civilians, to enable ambush attacks\n<Bullet/> They attack at short to medium range with long, chitin-like arm blades\n<Bullet/> Their adaptive physiology allows them to regenerate wounds rapidly"
; Codex: "<Bullet/> As far as we can tell, the aliens use these mysterious beings as armed hard drives\n<Bullet/> They appear to have direct control over their quantum states, allowing them to exist in several places at once. They exercise this capability when damaged\n<Bullet/> They can also cause weapons technology to malfunction, requiring the wielder to spend an action fixing affected gear"
; Gatekeeper: "<Bullet/> These enigmatic creatures occupy tough armored shells, and fly through the battlefield\n<Bullet/> They are capable of Psionically reanimating humanoids en masse\n<Bullet/> At close range they can drain a target's mental energy and take control of the brain-dead body\n<Bullet/> Like human Sharpshooters they can see anything their allies can see"
; Archon: "<Bullet/> These are the evolved version of the invasion-era Floater: underneath their angelic appearances they are the same cybernetic monstrosities they were during the war\n<Bullet/> They can goad themselves into a berserk frenzy, gaining extra actions\n<Bullet/> They can also fly to a vantage point over the battlefield and rain explosives in a large area"
; Sectopod: "<Bullet/> The Sectopod is ADVENT's most powerful war machine\n<Bullet/> It mounts a Wrath Cannon, which does terrifying damage to anything in the Sectopod's direct line of fire, but requires warm-up before discharge\n<Bullet/> It also mounts a cannon on the back for more precise engagement\n<Bullet/> The Sectopod's chassis enables it to rear up on its legs, expanding its vision and targeting areas"

; ADVENT Trooper: "<Bullet/> ADVENT Troopers are cheap to include in your squad, and offer limited tactical power\n<Bullet/> Low health and firepower make them ideal scouts or cannon fodder"
; ADVENT Officer: "<Bullet/> ADVENT Officers have more durability than the basic Troopers do, and augment other nearby ADVENT troops with their command presence\n<Bullet/> They also carry ADVENT grenades, similar to conventional frag grenades in power and area of effect"
; ADVENT Shieldbearer: "<Bullet/> ADVENT Shieldbearers are among the toughest ADVENT units\n<Bullet/> They can activate an energy field from their armor; this grants a temporary but durable shield to all nearby ADVENT units\n<Bullet/> Beware: if the Shieldbearer is killed, all shields he or she provided will dissipate"
; ADVENT Enforcer: "<Bullet/> ADVENT Enforcers are the frontline of the alien government's occupation army\n<Bullet/> They can use their Stun Lances to subdue targets instantaneously, or engage at range with standard ADVENT magnetic rifles\n<Bullet/> Be wary of allowing an Enforcer near your forces; they can take them out of the fight very quickly"
; ADVENT MEC: "<Bullet/> ADVENT MECs are powerful robotic combat units\n<Bullet/> In addition to a dangerous, high-caliber magnetic machine gun, they can deploy micro-missiles that detonate over a large area\n<Bullet/> They can also lay down suppressing fire\n<Bullet/> Anti-robotic gear, or Specialist combat training, can effectively counteract ADVENT MECs"
; ADVENT Shock Trooper: "<Bullet/> These ADVENT soldiers have more health and do more damage than the basic ADVENT Trooper, but they serve the same role\n<Bullet/> Their greater durability will make them much more useful in combat"
; ADVENT Lieutenant: "<Bullet/> ADVENT Lieutenants have all the same abilities as the more common ADVENT Officers, but can also designate targets for their subordinates\n<Bullet/> Units that attack a target marked as such by an ADVENT Lieutenant will receive Aim and Critical Chance bonuses"
; ADVENT Stun Lancer: "<Bullet/> The ADVENT Stun Lancer is a more heavily armored and aggressive variant of the Enforcer\n<Bullet/> The Stun Lancer prefers close combat, but can also engage at range"
; ADVENT Elite Trooper: "<Bullet/> This unit is the top-tier ADVENT basic trooper, with extra armor and firepower to match\n<Bullet/> This unit can serve a variety of tactical roles"
; ADVENT Captain: "<Bullet/> The ADVENT Captain is the most capable ADVENT leadership unit\n<Bullet/> ADVENT Captains have the best overall combat stats and access to all of the Officer-class units' abilities: target marking, command aura, and grenades"
; ADVENT Elite Lancer: "<Bullet/> The ADVENT Elite Lancer is the most dangerous ADVENT close combat unit\n<Bullet/> Be aggressive with the Elite Lancer; the Stun Lance can quickly remove high value enemies from the fight"
; ADVENT Shieldmaster: "<Bullet/> The ADVENT Shieldmaster is the most powerful ADVENT defensive unit\n<Bullet/> The Shieldmaster's energy shield is very hard to cancel out en masse, due to the Shieldmaster's toughness"
; ADVENT Myrmidon: "<Bullet/> The ADVENT Myrmidon is the most powerful ADVENT MEC\n<Bullet/> It mounts the standard set of ADVENT MEC weaponry, but is much tougher and more aggressive\n<Bullet/> When confronting a Myrmidon, the use of anti-robotic gear is strongly advised"

; @brian - we'll also need tactical text for soldier ability packages and PCS bundles to be used in MP

WillTutorialText="Over the course of a mission, the trials of battle will drain Soldier Will. With lower Will, soldiers have less defense against Psionic and disabling attacks and an increased chance to gain Negative Traits after the battle has concluded. Rest soldiers on the Avenger to recover their Will when possible because entering a mission with low Will can have additional negative effects."

TrackingShotTutorialTitle="Chosen Hunter: Tracking Shot"

DisplayName="ADVENT Datapad Decryption"
Summary="Our troops recovered one of the ADVENT datapads from the field, and there is valuable Intel stored within. We can recover the Intel, but it will require some time."
CodeName="Bletchley"
LongDescription="The ADVENT datapad is a basic field unit designed for storing and transferring intelligence that the aliens seem otherwise incapable of disseminating through their various communications networks. Although some effort was required to interpret the alien file system and decrypt their data, it seems as though ADVENT purposely kept the device's overall function relatively simple. The evidence is little more than circumstantial, but the design of these systems could be some indication of the lower-ranking ADVENT troops' overall mental acuity outside of designated tactical scenarios. R. Tygan."

[Tech_AlienDatapad X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Alien Data Cache Decryption"
Summary="Having recently discovered an alien data cache storing valuable enemy intelligence, I can dedicate my team's resources to decrypting the files and ensuring that we recover the large amount of Intel stored within."
CodeName="Enigma"
LongDescription="The alien data cache appears to be a physical storage device intended for direct interface with the datapads we've seen the ADVENT forces carrying in the field. Having successfully decrypted the files, including a variety of tactical data and varying intelligence, I've yet to discover what it is about this data in particular that requires the aliens to maintain physical stores of critical information. Considering the sophistication of their technology in general, one would think the inherent security risks involved would be enough to dissuade them. In any case, it can only benefit us to seize these assets whenever possible. R. Tygan."

CodeName="Insight"
LongDescription="Although it was a time-intenstive process, I was able to successfully decrypt the ADVENT data recovered by our troops in the field. As expected, the information includes the exact coordinates for one of ADVENT's remote facilities. With this knowledge in hand, we should be able to deploy a strike team to infiltrate and destroy the facility. I have no doubts that the loss of this site will deal a significant blow to the aliens' efforts towards the Avatar Project. R. Tygan."

[ModularWeapons X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Modular Weapons"
Summary="The magnetic rifles used by ADVENT's forces are incredibly complex weapons. The rifles themselves self-destruct when their original operator dies, but with a little effort we might be able to use any recovered parts to improve our soldiers' own weapons."
CodeName="Tinker"
LongDescription="We've had the troops digging through scrap piles and looting corpses, and at this point, it's safe to assume they're on constant vigil for anything we could use to improve our gear. All the raw materials in the world won't mean much if I can't find a use for them, but I think this modular weapon system is a good start. Having pushed our existing designs about as far as I thought possible, the integration of a few key alien components provided the much needed stability we've been looking for. With these modifications in place, we should be able to attach larger upgrades for even more firepower. The troops will like that. L. Shen."
UnlockedDescription="Weapon Upgrades Available"

[MagnetizedWeapons X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Magnetic Weapons"
Summary="An in-depth analysis of the ADVENT weaponry will no doubt lead to a greater understanding of their magnetic projectile dispersion systems. This should allow for the production of various magnetic-based firearms along with further insights into Gauss Weaponry."
CodeName="Orsted"
LongDescription="Having finally gotten a closer look at the Gauss rifle technology ADVENT has deployed among their forces, I'm fairly confident we can develop a magnetic weapon system of comparable power. The obvious question, why not simply use the ADVENT weapons directly, was discovered early on by Resistance forces in the field. Some years ago, the aliens began integrating a sort of genetic-verification technology into their weapons that prevents them from functioning by any species whose DNA has not been pre-encoded. Unfortunately, the system also exerts lethal force on an unsuspecting unauthorized user - a fact we should disseminate as widely as possible among the Resistance cells we have contact with. As for our own variation on the technology, Dr. Shen and I have taken components of the alien weaponry recovered from the field and utilized the key elements to develop a sustainable prototype. We can safely begin reproducing the system as the needed materials become available. R. Tygan."

[GaussWeapons X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Gauss Weapons"
Summary="With our mastery of ADVENT's core weapons technology, we can now develop specialized weapon systems using the alien technology to improve on power storage and consumption, projectile path fidelity, and penetrative force over greater distances. We may be able to develop a sniper rifle and cannon variant based on our newly learned Magentic Weapons technology."
CodeName="Friedrich"
LongDescription="The fact that we now have access to Gauss weaponry that is both combat effective and safe to operate at these power levels is quite an achievement. The overall design relies on advanced miniaturization technologies developed by the aliens which are, frankly, well beyond anything conceived of by Earth's leading military development firms at the time of the invasion. Despite our limited capability for extended test firings on board the ship, our latest prototypes are already capable of consistently accelerating an adaptive alloy projectile to over 5000 m/s in a simulated environment. We're still preparing the final assessment, but it is likely a field deployable unit would have to be limited to a lower power threshold due to the potential for ongoing strain to our troops when operating the weapons. R. Tygan."

[PlasmaRifle X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Plasma Rifle"
Summary="The plasma-based weapons wielded by the alien forces are considerably more powerful than anything used by ADVENT themselves. Although it will undoubtedly require extensive research, the impact of truly understanding this beam weapon technology could be immeasurable."
CodeName="Verdun"
LongDescription="On more than one occasion during our initial testing of the alien plasma rifles recovered from the field, we nearly suffered a catastrophic loss of the test unit while conducting simple firing runs. After a complete disassembly and analysis, it seems that the weapon operates along a very fine threshold between ideal power levels and total system failure. Even the smallest of micro fractures to any number of lightly-shielded components within the power distribution system could lead to a devastating collapse of field integrity, leaving little chance for the operator's survival. I can only assume at this point the aliens had little concern for the well-being of their own forces when designing the weapon, as I have no doubt they discovered this flaw during their own testing. In any case, I'll make the appropriate modifications to our internal designs to ensure no such weakness exists, for the safety of our troops. R. Tygan."

[HeavyPlasma X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Beam Cannon"
Summary="Although our early plasma weapon designs have already proven successful, further refinements and adaptations of the alien technology could lead to a weapon capable of destroying cover in the field." 
CodeName="Tunguska"
LongDescription="Tygan has been less than eager to push the limits of the plasma weapons we've come up with so far, and while I agree that we have to be careful working within the confines of the ship, I still don't think we can let that hamper our progress. The aliens are going to send whatever they can after us, and we should be prepared. With that in mind, I've come up with a few improvements to the core plasma rifle design that should allow us to step up the power without substantial increases to weight. With the added intensity, it might also be possible to divide the targeting field into a multi-shot projectile stream. I'm guessing the heavier variant will be best suited to the Grenadiers, they don't seem all that concerned about carrying around unstable ordnance. L. Shen."

[PlasmaSniper X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Plasma Lance"
Summary="Although the aliens apparently never created a long-range variant of their own plasma rifle design, that doesn't preclude us from experimenting with the concept. There are several issues we'll have to overcome, but the challenge is intriguing." 
CodeName="Crecy"
LongDescription="With the variety of hostile forces our soldiers are tasked with facing, it seems only logical to provide them with varying alternative means of engaging the enemy, in this case, from a much greater range than previously thought possible. By focusing the standard plasma bolt through a series of modulating rings, a single, powerful shot capable of devastating targets at extreme range can be produced. As is typically the case, the limitations of our environment preclude us from fully testing the bounds of these new plasma-based sniper rifles outside of a simulated environment. Regardless, I'm sure our troops will be eager to find these new limits on their own in the field, and I expect to hear of their exploits for some time to come. R. Tygan."

[AlloyCannon X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Storm Gun"
Summary="We've yet to discover the aliens' means of forging the alloy materials used throughout their structures and equipment. However, the alloy fragments have proven to be a more than effective projectile in initial testing when properly contained."
CodeName="Flak"
LongDescription="With the inherent difficulties in trying to forge or manipulate the alien alloys we've recovered from the field, our thought process as to how this material could be used to our advantage turned towards some of our more traditional, rudimentary weapons designs. In containing a small cluster of alloy fragments within a highly-energized magnetic field, we found it is possible to discharge the cluster using a plasma pulse of varying intensity. The overall design is akin to that of a shotgun, although the result comes more from our inability to form proper projectiles than it does from our desire to generate this particular outcome. Having seen firsthand some of the recent alien forces our troops have been dealing with, I have no doubts they'll still find this new design appealing for its overall stopping power. R. Tygan."

[Tech_Elerium X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Elerium"
Summary="The aliens, and to a lesser extent ADVENT, have long relied on the otherworldly element known as Elerium to power everything from their weapons systems to the UFOs themselves. It may take some time, but furthering our understanding of this material could greatly advance our own weapon and armor development projects."
CodeName="Mjolnir"
LongDescription="Having completed our analysis of the substance tentatively referred to as \"Elerium 115,\" it's clear that this material is unlike any other naturally occurring element on Earth. Presumably the aliens extracted their undoubtedly extensive stores of Elerium from another planet, but that is beyond my capacity to surmise. What I do know with certainty is that this element is incredibly reactive when exposed to high energy particle fields, providing a source of nearly limitless power that defies all known efficiency standards. Unfortunately, I see no means of replicating or synthesizing this substance with the resources available to us on Earth. The materials we recover from the aliens themselves will likely constitute the entirety of our available stockpile. The Commander will have to be careful in choosing how to allocate these precious resources. R. Tygan."

[Psionics X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Psionics"
Summary="Although we've seen them wielding Psionic powers before, our recent encounters with the aliens have truly shown us how they are able to deftly manipulate the flow of Psionic energy and use it to their advantage. If we were to master it as well as they have, the potential applications in the field would be limitless."
CodeName="Geller"
LongDescription="By closely examining the aliens' own means of harnessing and wielding Psionic energy, I believe the chances are good that we'll have more than enough viable candidates to serve as Psi Operatives. However, with the advanced Psionic capabilities we've seen from the various alien species in the field, it may not be enough. In preparation for this new class of soldiers, I've used the chip removed from the Commander to study the technology needed to focus and divert Psionic energy. As a result, I've developed a Psionic amplifier capable of focusing and enhancing the Psionic energy they will be trained to harness. Although the potential for negative side effects will be high, I foresee the possibility that our soldiers will be able to push their new powers beyond the limits of what we might consider safe. R. Tygan."

[HybridMaterials X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Hybrid Materials"
Summary="The ADVENT bodies we've recovered so far are shielded by a fascinating combination of materials, some more common than others. By studying the underlying alien technology, our research could lead to vast improvements to own our equipment."
CodeName="Slicker"
LongDescription="With limited resources available to outfit our troops, up until now they've had to make do with whatever makeshift armor Shen managed to piece together for them from various scrap materials. Relying on methods that might otherwise seem outdated, we've developed a means of producing a multilayered nanofiber weave capable of withstanding direct impacts as well as any traditional armor, without the added weight. Our troops will still have to exercise caution; even the nanofiber has its limits - it may be best suited to our forces who rely on agility over pure stopping power. In any case, I imagine our soldiers will be pleased to see any improvements over their current equipment. R. Tygan." 

[PlatedArmor X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Plated Armor"
Summary="Our understanding of the ADVENT armor is far enough along to allow for the fabrication of our own design mirroring their plated structure. The initial prototypes may be aesthetically rough, but functionally they'll be both light and strong."
CodeName="Yorrick"
LongDescription="We've recovered enough of the ADVENT armor to begin repurposing the outer plates into something better suited to our soldiers. The material itself seems to be the same as what the aliens utilized throughout the Avenger's hull, an extremely durable substance with an unusual ambient magnetic property. As an armor component, the magnetic fields surrounding these plates will actually provide additional protection against magnetic-based weaponry, most notably the gauss weaponry commonly equipped by ADVENT. R. Tygan."

[EXOSuit X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="E.X.O. Suit"
Summary="If we combine the power-assisted armor prototypes we've been working on with some of the ADVENT plating we've recovered, we could develop a heavy variant of our plated armor. More importantly, we might be able to add a heavy weapon mount directly to the armor, combining significant defensive and offensive capabilities in a single suit."
CodeName="Stark"
LongDescription="For the aliens, fielding heavier weapons, or more of them, usuallly means using a larger, heavier alien species to haul the gear into battle. For our needs, we have to rely on something more practical. I've has been working on a variety of power-assisted armor prototypes, which, at the very least, should provide a means for our troops to bring another weapon into the fight. By combining these prototypes with the alien alloy plating we've experimented with previously, the armor should also be incredibly durable, more so than anything we've provided to our troops previously. L. Shen."

[SpiderSuit X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Spider Suit"
Summary="Spotty records from the ruined mainframe at XCOM HQ indicate an early prototype for a light armor suit coupled with a grappling hook never came to fruition. Our recent mastery of the aliens' materials may allow us to revive the concept." 
CodeName="Fisher"
LongDescription="With the variety of environments our forces are currently engaging the enemy in, we need to give them every opportunity to gain a tactical advantage in the field. With that in mind, our latest armor prototype incorporates a basic powered-ascent mechanism capable of propelling the wearer to heights of over 10m with high levels of stability. The suit utilizes a number of micro-servo motors operating in sequence to aid in distributing the load throughout the armor, with the added side-effect of enhanced reflexes provided to the wearer. Although Central has made vague references to the previous science officer serving XCOM, he doesn't seem interested in discussing her efforts with me directly. I'm guessing the grapple design was something she created in collaboration with dad before XCOM fell. L. Shen."

[PoweredArmor X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Powered Armor"
Summary="Having found various means of integrating the alien materials within designs better suited to our own troops, I think it may be possible to assemble armor made entirely of the recovered alloys and powered by an Elerium cell. It should be incredibly strong, and able to withstand even direct hits from most alien weaponry."
CodeName="Goliath"
LongDescription="From what we've seen of the aliens' activities and their lack of regard for human life, preserving those of us that are still around has to become a task of equal importance to eliminating the alien threat itself. The success of this entire undertaking hinges on our ability to keep our soldiers healthy and ready for battle at a moment's notice. In working towards that aim, our latest armor prototype utilizes more of the alien alloys than any we've previously assembled, and as expected the durability and potential for damage mitigation is extremely impressive. Initial trials show the armor to be capable of withstanding a direct hit from focused plasma at 5m, enough so to increase survivability by a substantial margin. I plan on advising the senior staff not to inform the troops of any perceived toughness associated with the suit, I would hate for our forces to grow reliant on it despite our best intentions. L. Shen."

[WraithSuit X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Wraith Suit"
Summary="Having seen the aliens manipulating Psionic fields for a variety of purposes, we've theorized it may be possible to traverse through the physical confines of our world by developing a Psionic field enmeshed in a specially designed light armor suit."
CodeName="Loki"
LongDescription="Even though we're learning more about the alien's varying uses for the Psionic energy fields they manipulate, so far we haven't spent much time trying to harness these capabilities for our own purposes. Direct access to the biomechanical alien we've been calling the \"Codex\" has given us far better insight into the nature of Psionics than any of our previous experimentation. The Codex has the unique ability to phase through not just physical objects, but between worlds, and, in theory, dimensions. By focusing a carefully balanced pulse of Psionic energy, the Codex creates a rift, effectively peeling back the layers of spacetime. The possible implications of this ability are mind bobbling, but it's safe to say I won't be recommending we pursue this advance to the Commander. However, there are other areas of interest tied Codex. During our testing, we conceived of the possibility that the Psionic pulse could be diverted, or scattered, across an electromagnetic field integrated into a suit of armor. This would effectively create a weakened rift throughout the suit, allowing the wearer to phase through objects within our own dimension. The prototype is stable, but field trials are ongoing. L. Shen."

[WARSuit X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="W.A.R. Suit"
Summary="By harnessing the power of Elerium, it may be possible to create a new heavy powered-armor suit capable of generating a defensive force field not unlike those used on the alien craft."
CodeName="Titan"
LongDescription="With our supply of Elerium crystals limited by what our soldiers can recover in the field, I've been hesitant to recommend we commit them to any one project exclusively. However, in the wake of recent events, it seems like we need to work on developing an armor suit exceeding the durability and toughness of any of our previous designs. In order to do that, we've integrated an Elerium-based power cell into one our heavier frames. With the Elerium's incredible energy throughput, the suit can now support the use a self-contained force field. In the simplest of terms, we've mirrored the technologies most commonly used by the aliens in the defense of their UFOs, and fused them with a platform our troops can deploy in the field. I expect great things from this unit. L. Shen."

[AlienBiotech X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Alien Biotech"
Summary="Having successfully conducted the traumatic procedure required to remove the chip implanted by ADVENT, we now have an opportunity to study the inner workings of the device to gain a better understanding of their motivations."
Codename="Nano"
LongDescription="With little time to prepare, we were forced to conduct an extremely invasive procedure on the Commander in order remove what appeared to be an implant carefully enmeshed within the occipital lobe. Although all indications were that the device was not designed for removal, concerns as to the Commander's potential longevity, and the risk of possible remote manipulation by the aliens, left us with little alternative.\n\nDespite my concerns, the Commander has so far felt no lasting effects from the procedure and appears to be recovering ahead of expectations. As for the chip itself, my initial findings are alarming, to say the least. The device is Psionically-driven by the latent energy of the subject's brain, in this case, the Commander. More importantly, it appears the device functions as both a transmitter and receiver, relaying information via some form of Psionic link.\n\nEven after removal, I've had to shield the device to contain the residual Psionic fields surrounding the implant itself, for fear of what it might be capable of. If my current theory is correct, the Commander may have played a more important role in ADVENT's operations than we could have possibly imagined. R. Tygan." 

[AutopsySectoid X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Sectoid Autopsy"
Summary="Although the Sectoids have changed substantially since the invasion, their ability to manipulate Psionic energy has clearly not been diminished in the process. With a complete study of this new specimen, we may be able to develop the Psionic capabilities of our own troops."
CodeName="Kecksburg"
LongDescription="Preliminary autopsy exam conducted by Dr. Richard Tygan, acting science officer. Although my direct surgical experience is limited, the aliens' genetic manipulation of the species previously catalogued as a Sectoid provides a certain familiarity in relation to human anatomy. While the earliest documented accounts of Sectoids on earth indicated examples no larger than one meter in height, the specimens we encounter today are all nearly twice that size. Knowing full well that the aliens continue their efforts to integrate human and alien DNA, my findings here only reinforce the notion of a continuous development process. This larger Sectoid variant has an even greater proportion of human genetic material, selectively combined with the intention of improving the otherwise limited physical capabilities of the original. With enhanced Psionic capabilities and greater overall strength, I'd say they've succeeded. R. Tygan."

[AutopsyViper X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Viper Autopsy"
Summary="This creature is clearly reptilian in nature, although it appears to be not only sentient, but also highly intelligent. Still, the underlying physiology is remarkably similar to a number of terrestrial species - including the venom sacs, which we might be able to synthesize and incorporate for use in our medical supplies."
CodeName="Strangle"
LongDescription="I find it truly remarkable how adaptable some of the alien species' genetics are to the constant \"tweaks\" they're often subjected to. In the case of the \"Viper,\" a species once identified as the infiltration unit known as a \"Thin Man,\" the aliens have made a conscious reduction in their efforts to disguise its true form. Without the introduction of extensive human genetic material, the Viper reverts to a purely reptilian form while apparently retaining the same intellect and combat aptitude. The Viper's snake-like form is in many ways similar to the legless reptiles we commonly encounter on Earth. The enhanced torso musculature allows for upright mobility, and the addition of two physically weak but capable arms allows for the handling of traditional weaponry. Of the many alien species our troops encounter in the field, I find the prospect of encountering an intelligent snake standing over 2 meters tall to be among the most disturbing. R. Tygan."
AlertString="Viper"

[AutopsyMuton X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Muton Autopsy"
Summary="The aliens' primary shock troops are even more dangerous than they were when we faced them during the invasion. Our hope is that we can emulate their plasma-based explosives for our purposes."
CodeName="Surtur"
LongDescription="Having never seen any of the previous Muton variants personally, I can only go by the stories I've heard from Central Officer Bradford and others. As they say, the current breed is apparently on the smaller side, although considerably more agile than the originals. Internally, the subject maintains all the hallmarks of extensive genetic modification, with additional musculature and bone protecting the internal organs from any risk of direct contact. The aliens clearly spent a great deal of time and effort honing the abilities of the Muton as a front-line combat soldier. I had heard that our soldiers believe the Mutons to be part of a tribal society, at least originally, based on their unusual battle cries and markings seen in the field. Having finally gotten a closer look, I can confirm the presence of unusual scarification that could certainly be attributed to ritualistic behavior of some kind. R. Tygan."
AlertString="Muton"

[AutopsyBerserker X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Berserker Autopsy"
Summary="This unusual specimen is clearly afflicted by some form of extreme muscular hypertrophy, although how the species came to exist in this state will require a thorough examination. I suspect the research could lead to varying enhancements for our own troops, perhaps even some means of intensifying their own thirst for combat."
CodeName="Ragnarok"
LongDescription="This species was quickly tagged by our forces in the field as a \"Berserker,\" based on its often irrationally aggressive behavior on the battlefield. Upon initial examination, it's difficult to ignore the extreme muscle growth present throughout the specimen, leaving little need for extensive armor or even conventional weaponry for that matter. I suspect the added bulk of the subject to be the direct result of an intentional protein deficiency engineered by the aliens explicitly to create the hulking mass we see today. As for its behavior, I can only infer that was intended as well, as the aliens are well within their capability to manipulate the endocrine glands or equivalent for the purposes of hormonal behavioral control. In any case, this is an extremely dangerous and unstable species, best avoided by our troops at anything other than long range. R. Tygan."
AlertString="Berserker"

[AutopsyArchon X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Archon Autopsy"
Summary="An aesthetically impressive specimen, the hidden horrors of melding organic tissue with the inner workings of a machine are well-disguised here. The unique melee weapon employed by the creature could be of particular interest to our Rangers."
CodeName="Balseraph"
LongDescription="Brief eyewitness accounts, including one from our own Central Officer Bradford indicate that the aliens once fielded a similar biomechatronic organism during the earliest days of the invasion. Those reports however, describe a much more gruesome and rudimentary creature versus the subject we encounter in the present day. The modern specimen could almost be described as elegant in appearance; an authoritative, intimidating figure with the advanced weaponry to match. R. Tygan."
AlertString="Archon"

[AutopsyGatekeeper X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Gatekeeper Autopsy"
Summary="Our initial readings of the odd spherical creature we encountered show it to be of immense Psionic power, potentially rivaling that of the Elders themselves. It may be possible to reverse-engineer its biomechanical components for use in our own equipment."
CodeName="Barrett"
LongDescription="Having encountered a number of aliens capable of wielding Psionic power, it should come as no surprise that their aptitude and abilities are often unique to a given species. In this case the subject henceforth referred to as the "Gatekeeper," is on the extreme end of the spectrum in terms of Psionic sensitivity.\n\nHowever, our efforts to analyze the subject have so far revealed little in terms of its actual purpose or intention in the field. Unlike the Codex, so far we've found nothing that would allow the Gatekeeper to open or control a rift. All current indications point to an unusually independent, unpredictable species. R. Tygan."

[AutopsyAndromedon X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Andromedon Autopsy"
Summary="The beings that inhabit these suits clearly come from an environment utterly hostile to humans. The corrosive substance they use as a weapon may be the equivalent to water for them - but on this planet it's deadly. I've theorized as to how the substance could somehow be used to our advantage as part of an explosive weapons system."
CodeName="Levine"
LongDescription="Although I was extremely hesitant to perform an autopsy on this creature before an extensive analysis of the fumes vented with regularity from its suit, my concerns were overruled by the rest of the senior staff due to our overbearing time constraints. It was with some relief that I discovered the most common element to be Argon, an otherwise harmless gas when handled properly. Although similar in size and physical structure to the Muton species, the \"Andromedon\" as it's come to be known does not appear to be of the same genetic design as the Muton. I stress design here because perhaps more so than all but the most extreme examples, the Andromedon was engineered to exist only within the confines of the environmental suit we see them wearing in the field. Destruction of this protective equipment results in a reaction similar to what we might see if a human astronaut were to remove their helmet in space - that is to say, a painful and unpleasant death within minutes. R. Tygan."

[AutopsyFaceless X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Faceless Autopsy"
Summary="At one time, the Thin Men were the most advanced infiltration units available to the aliens. Now, we face a species capable of mimicking the human form at will. If we can come to understand how it is that they emulate us so effectively, perhaps we could develop a tool to deceive them ourselves."
CodeName="Protean"
LongDescription="Early reports from the Resistance referencing an alien creature said to be capable of \"shapeshifting\" were initially dismissed by local cell leaders who attributed the sightings to combat stress and malnutrition. It wasn't until our own forces engaged with the creature that we successfully confirmed its existence. Surprisingly enough, the description of the creature from those early reports was quite accurate.\n\nWith a varying height of up to three meters, the specimen currently referred to as the "Faceless" has one of the most unusual internal structures I've ever encountered. Where one might expect to find a skeletal foundation, we instead see a series of malleable chitin-like structures providing various points for the expansion of several equally unusual fluid membranes.\n\nThe membranes in question are responsible for the Faceless' extraordinary ability to mirror the form of a human. In recirculating key cellular combinations via an elaborate internal structure, the Faceless is capable of forming solid shapes while also mirroring colors and textures without physical sampling. As of yet we've only seen evidence of the Faceless attempting to imitate humans, but not other species or inanimate objects. Whether or not this is a limitation of their genetic makeup, or an intentional manipulation of their abilities by the aliens, we cannot say at this time. R. Tygan."
AlertString="Faceless"

[AutopsyChryssalid X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Chryssalid Autopsy"
Summary="They may have features resembling a variety of terrestrial insect species, but these creatures are deadlier than anything bred of our world. Their armored exoskeleton is of particular interest, and may provide insights towards the creation of an armor suit capable of actively damaging enemy forces as they engage in combat."
CodeName="Chrysalis"
LongDescription="An inherently terrifying and unpleasant species to encounter by surprise, I can only admire our troops for their courage in dealing with the species known as the \"Chryssalid.\" Mirroring the general form of a common Arthropod, immediately noticeable is the sleek, armored exoskeleton protecting its segmented body. Of particular concern for our troops are the honed points of the Chryssalid's fangs and legs, capable of inflicting critical injuries on their own, they also allow for the creature's gruesome means of rapid reproduction in the field.\n\nAlthough Central Officer Bradford insists that he witnessed a different, equally invasive means of Chryssalid gestation during the earliest days of the war, there is no evidence that such attacks still occur today. Unfortunately, from what he's described, I would say the aliens have actually evolved the process into a more efficient, and deadly, solution. The Chryssalids we see today inject a venom that immediately begins softening the structure of the victim's internal organs, preparing the subject to serve as a both the material for a gestation cocoon, and as a ready supply of nutrients for the Chryssalid young. Should the victim fail to receive medical support and expire, the cocoon will form shortly thereafter. Assuming the cocoon is not destroyed during the initial gestation period, we can expect up to three Chryssalid young to emerge after an impressively short period of growth.\n\nRecent reports from the field indicate some form of "burrowing" behavior, perhaps another evolution of past techniques, in this case likely for defensive purposes. Our troops would be well-advised to watch where they step in the future. R. Tygan."
AlertString="Chryssalid"

[AutopsySectopod X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Sectopod Breakdown"
Summary="This thing looks like something Earth's military planners would have dreamed about controlling 20 years ago. Heavy armor, advanced weapons systems, and yet still reasonably maneuverable in the field. Once we pull it apart, I'm hoping we'll find a means of improving on our GREMLIN designs."
CodeName="Cyclops"
LongDescription="When we first brought this thing in, some of the troops were still adamant that once we opened it up, we'd find a Sectoid or worse at the helm. Fortunately, our precautions weren't necessary; there's nothing organic inside, no "operator" providing physical directions. Unless they're triggering it remotely, all indications point to this \"Sectopod\" being an entirely autonomous weapon, operating according to the parameters of its system programming. This is exactly the sort of weapon that would have raised eyebrows in the past. I know dad would have been apprehensive about arming a robot and sending it on its way. It's pretty clear at this point the aliens aren't bound by any moral or ethical obligations; if it's efficient and destructive, they seem to have no problem setting it loose on us. L. Shen."
AlertString="Sectopod"

[AutopsyAdventTrooper X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="ADVENT Trooper Autopsy"
Summary="Now that we know the ADVENT are not pure human collaborators, but actual alien-human hybrids, close analysis of the fallen troopers' tissue might shed some light on the physiological changes the aliens have made. Their receiving neurochips might also enable us to create a device that would let us scan the battlefield without being noticed."
CodeName="Deacon"
LongDescription="The most public face of ADVENT security, the standard ADVENT Trooper serves in a first-response role in areas of high public exposure. Although rumors as to their origins have persisted for years, it's only recently that we've confirmed that they are in fact the product of a human-alien hybrid development. My initial autopsy indicates that the troopers were at one time entirely human, implying some means of gradual genetic enhancement without the rejection concerns that would normally plague these experiments. The body itself maintains the general outward appearance of a typical human, with the most crucial changes occurring in the cranial structure. It is my belief that the ADVENT troopers receive their orders, that is to say are controlled, directly through a Psionic link engineered as part of the genetic modification process. As we first discovered in the field, the eyes are notably larger, perhaps as an unintended side-effect, as they seem to provide only limited improvements to the Trooper's visual acuity. The aliens have managed to disguise this glaring physical trait from the general public through the use of cleverly designed armor. R. Tygan."
AlertString="ADVENT Trooper"

[AutopsyAdventStunLancer X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="ADVENT Stun Lancer Autopsy"
Summary="The ADVENT Stun Lancer is commonly seen maintaining order and quelling disturbances throughout the world. Their unique stun lance could be adapted into a weapon our Rangers are already training to use."
CodeName="Chaplain"
LongDescription="On both the physical and genetic level, the ADVENT Stun Lancers are nearly identical to the Troopers our forces regularly see in combat. However, a minor yet crucial adjustment to the muscle fiber density of the Lancer improves both agility and overall survivability. Equipped with non-lethal weapons capable of easily disabling human targets, these Lancers were first deployed during the earliest days following ADVENT's establishment of the city centers, when civil unrest was a more common problem than outright Resistance. In studying their usage and deployment, this raised an interesting question - if the Lancers were among the first ADVENT forces deployed, and their survivability is somewhat higher than that of the standard Trooper - did the aliens consciously reduce the Trooper's strength based on their assessment of human combat readiness? This would imply a system of rapid genetic modification beyond what I had previously imagined the aliens were capable of. It would also demonstrate a degree of \"genetic frugality\" that I would have previously assumed was irrelevant to the aliens, based on the variety of unusual experiments they've conducted. R. Tygan."
AlertString="ADVENT Stun Lancer"

[AutopsyAdventShieldbearer X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="ADVENT Shieldbearer Autopsy"
Summary="The ADVENT Shieldbearers are among the most heavily armored of the conventional alien forces. Once we've pulled the suit apart, I'm sure the engineering team will find some means of integrating these improvements into our own armor designs."
CodeName="Canon"
LongDescription="As is usually the case, our troops came up with the designation for this particular subject, currently known as the \"Shieldbearer.\" Initial indications are that it is tactically on-par with ADVENT's other humanoid field units, with no particular mental or physical advantages over the Officers or other units. The primary difference seems to lie in the armor suit itself, which is heavily reinforced with multiple layers of composite material woven from what I can only surmise to be some variation of the alien alloys. I intend on leaving the metallurgy and structural analysis to Shen and her team, who will no doubt find a means of integrating her findings into various experimental armor concepts of our own. R. Tygan."
AlertString="ADVENT Shieldbearer"

[AutopsyAdventTurret X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="ADVENT Turret Breakdown"
Summary="The ADVENT turrets rely on the aliens' advanced automation technology, providing security emplacements to bolster their \"peacekeeping\" forces. Once we've gotten a look at the inner workings, we may be able to integrate the technology to improve our chances of defending against UFO attacks."
CodeName="Acolyte"
LongDescription="We've run across the ADVENT turrets in a variety of places, mainly near the security checkpoints and other areas they're trying to lock down. Now that we've finally gotten a chance to pull one apart, I can say with certainty that the turrets are operating entirely on their own, with no outside controller or remote direction given.\n\nAs much as I'd like to test the targeting sensors, Central and Dr. Tygan have both expressed their concerns about test-firing the system before we know how it discerns between friendly and hostile targets. Considering how close the aliens' position these things to civilian occupied areas, the target recognition software must be incredibly accurate, or incredibly basic. I wouldn't be all that surprised if the aliens were just flipping the switch and setting these loose on anyone caught in the firing radius. I'll have to see about setting up some sort of test environment. L. Shen."
AlertString="ADVENT Turret"

[AutopsyAdventMEC X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="ADVENT MEC Breakdown"
Summary="These mechanized units have a familiar humanoid form, but we haven't found any indication of a pilot or biological control system. I'm hoping that once we've pulled it apart, I'll be able to mirror some of their advancements in our own weapons and robotic systems." 
CodeName="Cardinal"
LongDescription="From our initial breakdown, I have to assume the ADVENT MEC design was at least in-part based on the alien Sectopod, a similar autonomous war machine lacking in biological components. As far as I can tell, the ADVENT variant was supposed to be less intimidating, more suited for urban pacification, or \"peacekeeping\" operations conducted in proximity to the civilian crowds. That facade only works because of the carefully disguised weapons systems integrated throughout the machine. I don't think people would react so calmly if they knew about the micro-missile launching system linked to ADVENT's network, running facial recognition on the crowds at microsecond intervals. L. Shen."

[Skulljack X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Skulljack"
Summary="Before we even had time for field trials, the troops had already taken to calling it a \"Skulljack.\" In the simplest of terms, it's a physical interface designed to access the chip implanted in the ADVENT forces' skulls, applied using directed blunt force." 

[ExperimentalAmmo X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Experimental Ammo"
Summary="We've seen the aliens using a variety of exotic ammunition in their weapons. Using elerium cores we've recovered from the battlefield, we could develop new ammo types of our own that will likely be more potent than any of our our current munitions." 

[ExperimentalGrenade X2TechTemplate]

[BattlefieldMedicine X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Battlefield Medicine"
Summary="The venom injected by the Viper into its victims is nasty stuff, capable of taking down even the biggest, toughest soldier. However, it also contains a number of enzymes that could be isolated for use in our medikits, greatly improving coagulation at wound sites." 

[PlasmaGrenade X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Plasma Grenade"
Summary="In studying the aliens' more complex explosive ordinance, we concluded that the best means of advancing our own grenade designs was to scrap the conventional composition entirely.

This new \"Skullmining\" technique could lead to new intel gains from our enemies, and could even grant access to hidden Alien facilities for the purpose of sabotage. I can also upgrade our Skulljacks to significantly enhance the hacking ability of any soldier carrying one."

GameplayTips_Tactical[2]="Ambush enemies by placing multiple XCOM units in overwatch before breaking concealment."
GameplayTips_Tactical[3]="Overwatch shots suffer no aim penalties when triggered as part of an ambush."
GameplayTips_Tactical[4]="An increased Dodge stat can lead to \"graze\" shots, where only partial damage is applied."
GameplayTips_Tactical[5]="Overwatch will be canceled if the overwatching unit takes damage or is suppressed."
GameplayTips_Tactical[6]="Always attempt to flank enemies before attacking them. They will be easier to hit and score critical hits against."
GameplayTips_Tactical[7]="When evacuating a squad, the gear of any dead or incapacitated soldiers not carried from the battlefield will be lost."
GameplayTips_Tactical[8]="If a soldier becomes \"shaken\", they must rest on the Avenger and cannot be deployed on combat missions."
GameplayTips_Tactical[9]="Enemies with a \"target\" icon on their HP bars are visible from the movement cursor's current location; useful when previewing your soldiers' moves."
GameplayTips_Tactical[10]="Rangers with the Phantom ability will begin every mission in concealment, even if the squad does not."
GameplayTips_Tactical[11]="Hacking ADVENT towers with your Specialist soldiers can provide powerful tactical bonuses, but be careful: failing your hack can have negative consequences."
GameplayTips_Tactical[12]="As a soldier's position approaches a flanking angle on an enemy target, they can benefit from a \"Good Angle\" bonus to their hit percentage."
GameplayTips_Tactical[13]="Mission timers are suspended once XCOM and the Chosen engage in combat."
GameplayTips_Tactical[14]="Understanding and planning for a Chosen's unique strengths and weaknesses can be essential to defeating them in combat."

GameplayTips_Strategy[2]="Radio Relays reduce the intel cost of making contact with nearby regions."
GameplayTips_Strategy[3]="Choose the location of your radio relays wisely, as their cost increases with every relay you construct."
GameplayTips_Strategy[4]="Experimental projects in the Proving Grounds facility can be done multiple times, granting a different but equally powerful result each time they are undertaken."
GameplayTips_Strategy[5]="Power relay facilities provide a +10 increase to power capacity when built atop a power coil."
GameplayTips_Strategy[6]="Alien Autopsies can lead to powerful upgrades for your soldiers."
GameplayTips_Strategy[7]="Making contact and building radio relays across a continent can lead to unique and powerful bonuses."
GameplayTips_Strategy[8]="Enemy bodies are only collected as loot if XCOM does not \"evac\" from the mission."
GameplayTips_Strategy[9]="Elerium cores are valuable loot items, as they are required to create any specialized ammunition, grenades or armors in the Proving Ground facility."
GameplayTips_Strategy[10]="Any timed loot on the map is recovered if you complete the mission before the timer expires, but only if XCOM does not \"evac\" from the mission."
GameplayTips_Strategy[11]="Research Alien and ADVENT datapads for significant intel gains."
GameplayTips_Strategy[12]="To sabotage an alien facility and set back the aliens' Avatar project, you must first contact the region where the facility was built."
GameplayTips_Strategy[13]="The Avatar project can be temporarily delayed, but it cannot be stopped. You are in a race against time."
GameplayTips_Strategy[14]="The Defense Matrix facility greatly reduces the chance that an ADVENT Chosen will succeed in sabotaging the Avenger."
GameplayTips_Strategy[15]="The Ring facility provides powerful material and strategic rewards to XCOM, but requires a large roster of soldiers to operate efficiently."
GameplayTips_Strategy[16]="Higher bond levels between soldiers can provide powerful tactical benefits, but they require the Training Facility to complete."
GameplayTips_Strategy[17]="With the construction of the Training Center, Ability Points can be used to purchase new abilities for XCOM soldiers."
GameplayTips_Strategy[18]="Soldiers can be staffed in the infirmary to remove negative combat traits."
GameplayTips_Strategy[19]="When choosing soldiers for missions and covert actions, pairing highly compatible soldiers will allow powerful soldier bonds to form quickly."
GameplayTips_Strategy[20]="Hunting the Chosen down through the Ring facility will raise your influence with the Factions, leading to powerful new strategic rewards."
GameplayTips_Strategy[21]="The Chosen will continue to grow more powerful over time, gaining new tactical strengths in addition to powerful new strategic abilities."
GameplayTips_Strategy[22]="Tired soldiers can be deployed on combat missions, but they are prone to panic and likely to acquire negative combat traits."

CompletedSummaries[1]="Although evidence of post-invasion settlements still exist throughout this region, the area is devoid of life. Relying on the Avenger's main computer to triangulate likely positions of salvageable resources, we located a few supplies scattered throughout the nearby structures."
CompletedSummaries[2]="Although ADVENT conducts regular patrols throughout the region, pockets of Resistance in the area remain. We reached out to the local Resistance sources, and they pointed out several buildings nearby that they've been stashing contraband in. They offered up what they could spare."
CompletedSummaries[3]="An illegally operating transport truck broke down in the wastes and, upon seeing the Avenger moving in, the driver ran for cover. However, he quickly returned as our squad approached and asked for help with repairs. After our engineers got the vehicle running again, the driver handed over a few supplies in appreciation."

CompletedSummaries[5]="In spring of 2015, human military forces engaged one of the first alien battleships in the skies over this area. The civilian populace below was devastated during the ensuing battle. We deployed teams to sweep for possible salvage, and they returned with a number of resources found scattered throughout the area."
CompletedSummaries[6]="This crumbling sports arena was abandoned after years spent serving as a makeshift field hospital. The overgrown stadium is littered with crates and decaying equipment buried under the brush. Dr. Tygan was able to identify several items which retained their scientific value despite the conditions."
CompletedSummaries[7]="Beneath the looming statue of an Elder, we noticed an overgrown security checkpoint placed at the intersection of two roads. After further inspection, the corpse of an ADVENT security officer was discovered slumped over the small desk inside. Our engineers swept the site and recovered a number of useful system components."

CompletedSummaries[1]="Buried beneath the remains of a remote settlement, an old sewer duct now serves as a makeshift cell, confining a neglected ADVENT soldier to solitary confinement. While it's not clear who put him there, we were able to extract some limited intelligence from him before he expired."
CompletedSummaries[2]="Our low-power scans along the surface revealed faint life signs. On closer inspection, we discovered a badly wounded Sectoid tucked away in the ruins of an old building. After a limited interrogation, the Sectoid expired. We did manage to get some new information out of it first though."
CompletedSummaries[3]="The surrounding territory was pockmarked and burned, with ribbons of unusual discoloration marring the landscape. Using the scanners, we managed to follow the ribbons' trails to a downed alien patrol craft. With no signs of life nearby, our team quickly recovered what they could."
CompletedSummaries[4]="A pack of stray dogs were hovering over something along the roadside, a relatively uncommon sight since the ADVENT ban on all livestock and domesticated animals. When our squad approached, the strays hesitantly fled revealing a field littered with alien bodies. We recovered the specimens for Dr. Tygan's research."
CompletedSummaries[5]="Scans picked up a seemingly endless convoy of supply trucks leaving an ADVENT production facility in this region. One of the trucks seems to have lost its way, enough so that we were able to intercept it and recover the alien technology it was carrying."
CompletedSummaries[6]="An odd crystalline substance caught the attention of our low-frequency scanners, it seems to be overtaking the local plant life throughout this area. Our troops were wary of approaching the faintly glowing strands, but they reluctantly recovered a sample for Dr. Tygan to study."
CompletedSummaries[7]="A stone wall running alongside an overgrown pasture was strewn with the corpses of several alien species. The bodies are deeply decayed, but still hold scientific value. Not wasting an opportunity to examine the alien xenobiology for weaknesses, a team brought the corpses on board for Dr. Tygan to study."

CompletedSummaries[1]="A large bonfire rages around what was once a makeshift structure of some kind, but there are no signs of life nearby. Although the building was picked clean, our scans located alien resources hidden within the building that survived the fire."
CompletedSummaries[2]="We located what appeared to be a hastily covered mass-grave occupying much of the surrounding area. After reluctantly excavating part of the site, our team discovered several badly wounded Sectoid corpses. Their weapons and equipment are still intact, and can be disassembled for valuable resources."
CompletedSummaries[3]="Sweeping the area revealed little on the surface, but sensor readings indicated something buried nearby and we used high explosives to uncover the object. Once the dust settled our team found several alien stasis pods buried among the remnants of what was once a heavily-reinforced structure and quickly broke them down into raw materials."
CompletedSummaries[4]="Approaching the remains of a Resistance Haven, there are no immediate signs of life. A strange alien beacon is embedded in the roadway nearby but it seemed to be inactive. Shen requested we bring the device on board for a more thorough inspection."

[ResistanceCommunications X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Resistance Communications"
Summary="We know there are isolated pockets of Resistance around the world just waiting for someone to reach out and organize them. To unite the Resistance and forge a global movement, we'll need a means of communicating that is both secure and discreet." 
CodeName="Cypher"
LongDescription="Although conceptually the idea of establishing a radio-based communications system for the purposes of organizing a Resistance movement is nothing new, harkening back to any number of Earth's previous wars, what we hope to accomplish here is still no small task. The aliens are particularly adept at detecting our signals, with a vast array of technology and resources at their disposal. However, working in close collaboration with Chief Engineer Shen, we've begun to salvage some of the aliens' own communications equipment from within the Avenger itself. From studying the surviving log files, we've discovered an astounding number of simultaneous communications being distributed through their network at any given time. This has proven to be the key to our proposed solution; with so much traffic flowing through the alien network, it should be relatively easy for us to disguise our own transmissions among theirs. Using the Avenger as our central hub, we can establish a communications network linking Resistance outposts around the globe. Every new contact we establish should organize and strengthen the movement as a whole. R. Tygan."
UnlockedDescription="Resistance Contacts Available"

[ResistanceRadio X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Resistance Radio"
Summary="By replicating the communications equipment we've developed on the Avenger, we should be able to establish ground-based relays to further spread our reach. With wider coverage, it'll be easier for us to reach some of those outlying regions far off from HQ."
CodeName="Marconi"
LongDescription="The Avenger serves our purposes adequately in terms of coordinating our communications network, but if we hope to increase our range and reach every possible outlet, we will have to do more. A series of carefully positioned relay towers would suffice, asuming we can miniaturize the technology we've adapted from the aliens' own communications equipment. It may be difficult to balance the requisite power levels versus the increased chances of detection, but this is our best chance to expand on our capabilities. With the increased coverage, we can expect the efficiency of local Resistance operations to improve, strengthening the groups working within range of the towers. R. Tygan."
UnlockedDescription="Radio Relays Available"

[AutopsyAdventOfficer X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="ADVENT Officer Autopsy"
Summary="Aside from the variety of fascinating genetic enhancements found in the ADVENT Troopers, the Officers appear to be augmented further with some kind of biomechanical implant. I believe this allows for some form of communication throughout the alien hierarchy. If we were to somehow tap into this system, I wonder, what might we hear?"
CodeName="Bishop"
LongDescription="Physically larger and more tactically capable than the subordinate troopers, the ADVENT Officers administer a system of control over the Troopers through a carefully engineered Psionic link augmented with a mechanical implant. From my initial examination of the Commander and a careful review of the information gathered in the Alien containment area, I now have a theory as to how this system was established.\n\nIt is my firm belief that this process of Psionic control was specifically engineered to allow rapid deployment of tactical information drawn directly from the subconscious mind - in this case, the mind of our very own Commander. With this hierarchy in place, tactical knowledge stored in the depths of the Commander's mind was processed and transmitted to the ADVENT Officer's, who in turn directed the Troopers and other subordinates. With the Commander no longer attached to their Psionic network, it's difficult to say how the orders are being dispersed at this point - although I'm sure the aliens have planned for this potential contingency.\n\nI believe it may be possible to tap into this \"Network,\" but it would require the use of a living ADVENT Officer to function as our conduit. To facilitate this difficult task, we've worked to develop a new device, the \"Skulljack,\" which should be capable of disabling an Officer. From there, it's simply a matter of hacking the Officer in the field - although I won't speculate as to the outcome. R. Tygan."

[AlienEncryption X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Alien Encryption"
Summary="Unlike the conventional encryption methods we would typically encounter with terrestrial data stores, the aliens appear to be using an advanced matrix consisting of both mechanical and biological cyphers, combined with some form of Psionic interference. The thought of uncovering the aliens' most complex designs is both intriguing and frightening in equal measure."
CodeName="Railfence"
LongDescription="Before we can even begin to attempt decrypting the alien data stores, we must first come to understand the means by which they protect their most valuable data. It was immediately clear that the aliens do not rely solely on conventional algorithms, but instead use a complex matrix of interwoven biological signatures as part of the cypher itself. An additional layer of protection is afforded by an ongoing field of Psionic interference, tied directly into the ADVENT network itself. If we're to have any chance of defeating the multiple safeguards the aliens have in place, it's likely we'll have to design specialized equipment to isolate each layer of encryption before we attempt to press on with our investigation. R. Tygan."

[CodexBrainPt1 X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Codex Brain"
Summary="This biomechanical component, what we've referred to as the \"Brain,\" is all that remains of the Codex our forces encountered in the field. We should endeavor to extract whatever information we can, time is of the essence."
CodeName="Rubik"
LongDescription="The Codex itself is a remarkable entity, far beyond our expectations of what a sentient, biological organism could or should be. Our limited exposure to it leaves a number of open questions, and as it appears to phase or flux out of our visible spectrum, it will undoubtedly prove to be a difficult specimen to study. In any case, our troops were able to recover what can only be described as the Codex \"Brain,\" a central processing unit encompassing data storage, communications, tactical control, as well as a host of other functions we've yet to identify.\n\nWith the Shadow Chamber in place, Shen and I conducted a thorough, albeit difficult series of experiments to unravel the mysteries of the device. Through a series of high-frequency exposures, we were successful in forcing the Codex to reveal itself, beyond the confines of the Brain alone. Shen expressed varying concerns about the well-being of the Codex, as it appeared to be responding, and even resisting, our efforts to decrypt the data and access the ADVENT network. I assured her any indication of pain or active intolerance of our testing was merely a byproduct of the procedure. Before the Codex destroyed itself, along with our containment area, we did manage to recover a subset of the data containing what appears to be a set of map coordinates. It will take more time to work through the remaining fragments, but in the interim we have a lead to pursue. R. Tygan." 

[CodexBrainPt2 X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Encrypted Codex Data"
Summary="Our initial efforts to delve into the Codex Brain data provided us with a sequence of map coordinates. However, we still have fragments of data that the Codex attempted to destroy, which would imply a value to this data far beyond what we've discovered so far."
CodeName="Enigma"
LongDescription="With time set aside to further analyze the data fragments leftover from our initial Codex experiment, I've finally managed to crack their code - and the resulting data is perhaps more valuable, and shocking, than I had expected. I understand now why the Codex was willing to sacrifice itself to protect this information.\n\nIn the shadows, the alien overseers, known to us as the "Elders," have continued to work in secret since the very beginnings of ADVENT. Although Central Officer Bradford tells me that no one has seen an Elder in the flesh for over a decade, we continue to see monuments in their likeness throughout the city centers. This is because they never left: they simply fell into the shadows, focusing their efforts on a more dire concern - the Elders are dying.\n\nAmong the diverse and widely varied alien specimens we've encountered, the Elders are uniquely afflicted by some form of rapid muscular degeneration. Their physical forms are no longer capable of containing the Psionic energy that is the Elders' lifeblood. Just as we've encountered these unique alien species in the field, at some point in the past, the Elders encountered them as well - and used them in an attempt to cure this plague among their own kind. Unfortunately for them, and for us, it seems they've never found this cure, and now it appears they are looking to use humanity as their next candidate. R. Tygan." 

[BlacksiteData X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Blacksite Vial"
Summary="Recovered from the ADVENT Blacksite, this unknown substance appears to be the product of an equally gruesome and intensive refining process. As to its composition or purpose, that is yet to have been determined."
CodeName="Chrysopoeia"
LongDescription="My initial curiosity and excitement regarding our earlier discoveries involving the recovered alien data have been all but extinguished by the disturbing results of my latest tests. Having analyzed the composition of the green-hued substance retrieved from the ADVENT Blacksite, I can only draw one conclusion - that the facility was designed solely for the refinement and production of concentrated genetic material - human genetic material.\n\nWith the entirety of our ship's systems dedicated to my analysis, I found that the single vial we recovered contains the unique human genomes of over one million subjects. One million people, convinced to join the ADVENT cities out of desperation, then subjected to appalling experiments that eventually cost them their lives. To what end, I can only imagine. R. Tygan." 

[ForgeStasisSuit X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Recovered ADVENT Stasis Suit"
Summary="Within the stasis suit recovered from the ADVENT \"Forge\" facility, we are detecting a humanoid organism of some kind. A new type of ADVENT soldier? An alien being heretofore unseen? Considering the level of security in place to protect this asset, it is surely important to the aliens, though it will take a thorough analysis to discover their ultimate intentions for it."
CodeName="Golem"
LongDescription="Having already suspected that the material being produced at the first ADVENT Blacksite was tied directly to the aliens' operations at the Forge facility, it isn't entirely surprising to me that we've now discovered the apparent \"product\" of these efforts.\n\nPresented in some form of stasis or containment suit similar in appearance to that in which we found the Commander, the subject is vaguely humanoid in form. The physical similarities aren't as readily apparent beyond first impressions, as the specimen appears to be in an \"incomplete\" state, which I initially theorized could be the result of an elaborate cloning operation. Unfortunately, having completed an extensive analysis of the subject's DNA and genetic structure, I believe clones would have been the lesser concern.\n\nWhat we have actually recovered is a \"foundation,\" the structure upon which a new lifeform could be built, assuming we hadn't disrupted the process. Knowing what we do about the aliens' activities at the Blacksite, it is my unfortunate conclusion that the human captives, be they prisoners or abductees, were processed and consumed as part of the development of this specimen.\n\nNotably, the human genetic material involved in this process comes from the more Psionically sensitive members of the human population, no doubt an intentional culling carefully executed by ADVENT's forces. Regardless, one question remains - what is the missing component? What is intended to fill the genetic void that would have brought this creature to life? R. Tygan."

[PsiGate X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Psionic Gate"
Summary="The map coordinate data recovered from the Codex brain led us to this: a powerful Psionic artifact embedded deep in the wilderness. The question is: if this is truly a gateway, then what lies on the other side?"
CodeName="Heiroglyph"
LongDescription="Although the logistical concerns involved in transporting a large piece of potentially unstable alien technology were difficult to manage, they are easily dwarfed by the risks involved in attempting to operate this device within the confines of the Avenger. Although Shen and I both had our concerns, given the directives of our operation, we saw little alternative but to begin experimenting on this Gateway as soon as possible.\n\nAfter a period of slow, deliberate power increases accompanied by the appropriate level of monitoring, we felt comfortable enough to leave the Gateway operating in its idle state. At that point, we conducted a series of simple tests on various objects to better understand how the aliens use the device for transportation. Initially, we saw no means of actually putting the Gateway into an active state. That is to say, the Gateway itself seemed to disregard or ignore the objects we passed through.\n\nHaving studied the alien Codex and its ability to open rifts in the field for deployment, we theorized the Gateway may be tied to a similar signal or key integrated into the Codex itself. Sure enough, by mirroring the frequencies found in close proximity to the Codex, we found that the Gateway itself enters a second, active condition.\n\nShen was hesitant to relegate her pet GREMLIN to use in our experiment, but she recognized the value in having a remote test subject, and we had no other units available to spare. Unfortunately, our initial theories as to the Gateway's function overlooked the possibility that it was also tied to the biological components of the Codex. Shen's personal GREMLIN suffered some relatively minor damage during our test, but its sacrifice led to an important revelation in terms of how we might access this Gateway and discover its source. R. Tygan." 


[AutopsyAdventPsiWitch X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Avatar Autopsy"
Summary="The aliens built an elaborate new society, a government structure and a system of careful manipulation solely to fuel the creation of this, their so-called \"Avatar.\" At the cost of countless human lives, they have finally succeeded."
CodeName="Primarch"
LongDescription="We have dedicated the entirety of our efforts to discovering the purpose of the Avatar Directive, and now, it seems we're finally gaining ground on the aliens. With that said, I was shocked to see that our troops not only encountered what was apparently a fully responsive Avatar specimen, but that it engaged them in combat and was subsequently dispatched with only moderate difficulty.\n\nWith all that went in to its creation, somehow I expected that the Avatar would be a foe unlike any other, something perhaps even beyond our own capabilities to counter. Initially, it appeared as though my assumptions were wrong.\n\nHumanoid in form, the physical attributes of the Avatar specimen are, on the surface, wholly unremarkable. It has a musculature system not all that unlike a young adult human, with no obvious genetic adulterations to enhance its physical strength or agility. At this point I could only surmise that the aliens focused entirely on what lies beneath the Avatar's seemingly ordinary structure.\n\nAs I continued my analysis of the Avatar specimen, including a rapid genetic sequencing aided by the Shadow Chamber, I discovered my earlier conclusions could not be further from the truth. This Avatar, what was left of it, is still not \"whole\" in a developmental sense. Although portions of the missing genetic links have since been filled with what is undoubtedly Elder DNA, there are still gaps; incomplete sequences that leave the creature unable to fully sustain its own power. It is now my firm belief that we have yet to encounter a fully developed Avatar, and its potential capabilities at full strength leave me deeply concerned. R. Tygan."

DescriptionTitle="Propaganda Assessment"
DescriptionEntry="The following directives have been identified by Resistance analysts based on a thorough review of ADVENT's ongoing propaganda effort. The aliens' key areas of focus as directed towards the civilian populace are: recruitment of an increasing number of civilians into the city centers; nurturing an atmosphere of distrust to encourage self-reporting among city center inhabitants; encouragement of the belief that so-called \"dissident groups\" are to blame for perceived faults; disassociation of traditional beliefs and value systems in favor of adulation for the Elders."

Despite the open hostility initially directed towards these peaceful alien visitors, they were receptive to the possibility of coexistence.

In the twenty years since, ADVENT has effectively served humanity and created an environment of peace and prosperity."

DescriptionEntry="Initially conceived of as a means to defend against unforeseen threats to the Earth as a whole, the XCOM project was first outlined during secretive planning sessions conducted throughout the year 1993. Although these early discussions were only meant to establish the theoretical principles of defense against an unknown enemy, all agreed upon preparations were carried out by the participating Council nations immediately. For more than two decades, the project remained dormant, with limited personnel records maintained by an agreed upon representative of the Council.\n\nIn February of 2015, long distance scans indicated a number of large unidentified objects on a slow approach towards Earth. As agreed upon, the XCOM project was activated on February 10th, with key personnel assignments filled by the latest active candidates on file. In less than two months' time, open hostilities between the aliens and Earth's forces ravaged much of the planet's developed world leaving the survivors desperate and alone."

First assigned to operational directive XCOM Project February 14, 2015. Primarily serving an organizational role, providing tactical and strategic support to XCOM's commanding officer, Central Officer Bradford was chosen for his loyalty and commitment to the task at hand. Unfortunately, a gross underestimation of the aliens' numbers and technological advancement left Bradford and XCOM with limited capability to fend off the invasion.\n\nWithin a matter of weeks, XCOM's underground headquarters was infiltrated and destroyed, leaving the organization in shambles. Bradford was apparently left to fend for himself, surviving in the shadows, nurturing a growing affection for distilled spirits. In the time since, he did manage to secure connections within the Resistance, providing the foundation for renewed XCOM operations across the globe.\n\nC.O. BRADFORD [SYSTEM DICTATION]: I'm not sure who's compiling the personnel reports these days, judging by the language I'm guessing Tygan, but let's get a few things straight. There was no \"gross underestimation\" of the aliens, we knew exactly what was coming, and we pulled together the best men and women the world had to offer. It wasn't enough. They used our own people against us, some kind of Psionic control, took down our security grid from the inside. I did everything I could. I know Shen got out, but I lost track of Vahlen...

Before the invasion, Dr. Tygan worked in the pharmaceutical industry primarily studying immunosuppressant drugs for use with organ transplants procedures. With the collapse of the global economy following the war, Tygan was left with little alternative in terms of utilizing his skillset outside of ADVENT's widespread calls for cooperation among the scientific community. Employed in one of the earliest gene therapy clinics, Tygan found himself thrust into a project dealing with cranial implants.\n\nAfter growing disenfranchised by some of the processes he witnessed while serving under ADVENT, Tygan sought contacts within the Resistance in the hopes of atoning for his contributions to ADVENT's work.

Unfortunately, he was only in the initial stages of his training when the invasion took a turn for the worse. Though he miraculously survived, Geist was in the midst of a delicate procedure as the attack began.  Left alone and suffering from amnesia, his Psionic abilities helped him survive in the lands surrounding the ruins of the XCOM base. It is believed that Geist may have taken his name from the project codeword assigned by Vahlen to the Psi-Ops training initiative run by XCOM."

They also seem to operate with near autonomy from the Elders themselves with varying degrees of reverence for their creators.

I haven't seen anything that happy in a long time.\"\n\nFILE: TMPL-A102 TEMPLAR COLLECTED ACCOUNTS OF "WARLOCK" 2030.00.00\n\n\"We know the one you speak of, we refer to it as the \"Warlock,\" and it has haunted us for some time now. It is a being of unmatched Psionic power, perhaps near to that of the Elders themselves. They have absconded with much of the Earth's life force, and it would serve us all well to see it returned. Eyewitness accounts and collected intel to follow. -GEIST\"\n\nCOMM: TMPL-REF FIRST REPORTED SIGHTING APPROXIMATED 2027.8.9 TEMPLAR SCOUT HITKA\n\n\"We all felt its presence long before we ever saw it. Where it moves, there is a great disruption in the flow of energy, the Earth below us feels it as well. At first we believed it to be just another alien, albeit a powerful one at that. But then it began to speak from the distance as if it stood just before us. It called out to us in the Elders' name, and warned us that our time here was nearing its end. Once it fell silent, we moved away as quickly as possible, not knowing what to think.\"\n\nCHOSEN WARLOCK REPORTS GATHERED BY TEMPLAR SOURCES 2030.00.00-\n\n\"...it was as if he stepped out of the Void itself, suddenly it was just there with us, declaring our ways an affront to the Elders. I have never felt a power like it before...\"\n\n\"I saw it raise the dead! Some of theirs, and some of ours! His power transcends our world!\"\n\n\"He is the Elders' most loyal zealot, a fanatic to match even the most devoted followers of Geist himself.\"\n\n\"It knows more about us than any other alien we've encountered. It speaks to us as if we were old acquaintances. Another trick of the Elders no doubt.\"\n\n\"We have heard rumors of others like him, but we have never seen him travel with any sort of companions. He seems to show disdain even for those others who share the same master.\""

[AutopsyAdventPurifier X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="ADVENT Purifier Autopsy"
Summary="With a greater understanding of the systems behind the ADVENT Purifier's unusual tolerance of environmental hazards, it will likely be possible to emulate their methods for some use in our own equipment."
CodeName="Piezo"
LongDescription="Officially designated as a \"Purifier\" unit among ADVENT's various field-deployed personnel, these hybrid soldiers appear to have been specifically designed and equipped for high-temperature exposure. In the field, the Purifier is unique in its exclusive wielding of a portable flamethrower, no doubt ADVENT's direct response to the increasing number of Lost that seem to be overtaking the outlying territories.\n\nHowever, despite their often-times reckless use of these flammable materials, the Purifier is seemingly immune to the intense heat and even direct exposure to the flames that accompany their gruesome work. Although I would have initially hypothesized that much of this tolerance comes from the design of their armor, my autopsy has revealed something else entirely.\n\nWhile a cursory examination would have us believe that the Purifiers are no different from the other humanoid ADVENT forces, this is not the case. The skin of the Purifier is wholly unique--whereas we might find 10 to 20 layers of interwoven cells in a typical human--the outermost epidermal layer of the Purifier is nearly three times that thickness in any given area of their body, with an unusual capacity for both absorption and retention of moisture.\n\nWorking in conjunction with armor specifically designed to support this function by pulling moisture from the surrounding atmosphere, the Purifier is essentially immune to the oppressive heat generated by their own weaponry. While I would be remiss to praise the aliens for their questionable practices, I must admit their ingenuity in approaching these targeted genetic manipulations is nothing short of exceptional. -R.

[AutopsyAdventPriest X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="ADVENT Priest Autopsy"
Summary="An exhaustive autopsy of the Psionic ADVENT unit known as the \"Priest\" will no doubt improve our understanding of how they have come to wield so much power, and how we can mirror their abilities for our own purposes."
CodeName="Apostle"
LongDescription="Among the aliens' more reclusive forces, the ADVENT unit we've come to identify as the \"Priest\" has recently become a regular sighting for our forces deployed in the field. These Priests apparently wield a great deal of power over their subordinate ADVENT units, relying on Psionic control to issue orders and exert their will in battle.\n\nWhile their physical appearance is no more striking than that of a typical ADVENT soldier, their talents in wielding Psionic energy clearly differentiates them from the standard hybrid unit. Based on my post-mortem examination, I believe the source of this increased proficiency comes from careful genetic manipulation, a hallmark of the Elders' forces. In this case, an unusual synaptic configuration allows for what I believe to be Psionic transduction between otherwise distinct and unrelated cell types found throughout the body.\n\nIn combat, these increased pathways for the storage and release of Psionic energy allow the Priest to project control over its enemies in the field, while bolstering the survivability of its allies. Perhaps most critically, the Priest has been known to sustain its own life force through Psionic manipulation, cheating death in a way not seen among the Elders' other subordinate alien races. In the interest of preserving our troops' lives, I've made this particular skill the focus of my research going forward. -R. Tygan."

[AutopsyTheLost X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="The Lost Autopsy"
Summary="By improving our understanding of how and why the Lost have come to overrun the cities of the old world, it is likely that we can develop a means of avoiding or perhaps manipulating their movements."
CodeName="Limbo"
LongDescription="From the field reports I have managed to assemble, the first sightings of the \"Lost\" likely occurred more than a decade ago, as members of an independent resistance cell in North America encountered what they referred to at the time as \"infected\" civilians. With little in the way of options, the cell leader, a man named Tony Cross, ordered these infected to be destroyed on sight. Knowing what we do now, I can say with confidence that Cross' order may very well have curbed the initial spread of the Lost and saved us from yet another insurmountable threat.\n\n Conducting an autopsy on a subject culled from one of the Lost swarms has proven to be among the more troubling and emotionally-draining procedures I have faced in my time serving XCOM. It was clear from our initial discovery of these creatures in the field that they were once human, with most among them having been civilians. With that knowledge in mind, it fell to me to discover the cause of this extreme, grotesque corruption of these unsuspecting victims.\n\nBased on their proximity to the abandoned cities of the invasion and the information gathered from various eyewitness accounts, our most plausible theory as to the origins of the Lost revolves around the so-called \"Fog Pods\" dropped throughout these cities during the earliest days after the aliens' arrival on Earth. The gas released from these pods was never fully studied, as the invasion took a turn for the worse and Earth's governments were focused entirely on defensive efforts. Unfortunately, with no sample of that particular toxin available today, our focus remained on the subject presented here.\n\nMuch like the Psionic \"zombies\" we have encountered previously, the Lost defy most known medical science that existed before the arrival of the aliens. Despite a catastrophic level of tissue decay, the Lost remain vigorous and agile in the field, attacking on what can only be blind impulse. Their senses are also inexplicably heightened, as they are quickly drawn to the sounds of activity. To the delight of our troops, the traditional lore of Earth still applies today, as any damage to the cranial tissue of the Lost...a headshot, has proven to be the absolute means of termination.  As to what it is that changed these unfortunate souls into what they are today, or better still what it is that drives their otherwise lifeless forms, we may never know. -R. Tygan."

[AutopsySpectre X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Spectre Autopsy"
Summary="Known simply as a Spectre, the study of this being will no doubt lead to revelations as to its unnerving ability to conceal itself and move beyond the confines of the humanoid form." 
CodeName="Haunt"
LongDescription="Despite having reviewed both reconnaissance footage and eyewitness accounts from our soldiers in the field, until I had seen this specimen in person, it did not fully register just how unusual it is. Known colloquially as a \"Spectre\" based on its shadowy form, in the field, the subject is most often seen maintaining a roughly humanoid form. However, when moving or engaging in combat actions, this form is quickly broken to reveal the truly amorphous nature of the Spectre.\n\nAlthough I had conceived of a number of theories as to how this was taking place, e.g. swarming nanorobots, alien insects, perhaps even some sort of Psionic particle-matrix, it isn't immediately clear that any of those hypotheses are out of the realm of possibility.  As of yet we've found no means of recovering one of these Spectres in their \"assembled\" form, leaving little evidence as to their true composition. Although it would seem likely that the Spectre holds some intrinsic connection to the equally elusive Codex, their means of traversing our world are distinct enough to require a different approach if we hope to further our research. -R.

[ChosenAssassinWeapons X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Assassin Weapons"
Summary="The Chosen Assassin proved deadly with both her sword and her shotgun, and both will no doubt be valuable to our efforts.  However, I believe the sword, conceivably forged by the Elders own hands, to be the true asset here."
CodeName="Hanzo"
LongDescription="Having recovered both of the Chosen Assassin's weapons from the field, a shotgun and a modular sword, I must admit I am intrigued by the advances the aliens have managed to craft into these otherwise conventional weapons.\n\nThe shotgun, used primarily as a secondary weapon by the Elders' Assassin, is elegant in its simplicity and adherence to a singular purpose. Built upon an advanced composite frame, in close quarters the unique design is nearly unmatched by any other projectile weapon. During repeated field trials, the fully enclosed Magnetic Ordnance Reduction System consistently delivered a tightly patterned array of alloy fragments capable of penetrating all but the most unyielding of targets.\n\nThe Assassin's prized sword is something else entirely, and may be among the more unique and perhaps important weapons we have ever recovered. Despite attempts at nondestructive analysis of the sword's composition, including variations on X-ray fluorescence, I have yet to make any significant progress towards identifying the material in question. As it stands, we know only that the sword is forged of a non-terrestrial metallic element held in tight suspension by Psionic energy that is itself contained by forces unknown. By all accounts, this weapon is a prize for both the warrior and the scholar alike. -R. Tygan."

[ChosenHunterWeapons X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Hunter Weapons"
Summary="The prized weapon of the Chosen Hunter, this rifle was no doubt responsible for countless assassinations in the field. Through our research, we will see whether credit truly goes to the weapon or the one who wielded it."
CodeName="Elysium"
LongDescription="Aside from the Elders' Assassin, from what I have seen there is none other among the aliens who valued their weapon as dearly as the Chosen Hunter, and perhaps justifiably so. Visually striking for its lean, sleek appearance, this prized rifle is a testament to the aliens' true potential in refining a system down to its purest form.\n\nAt its core, the Hunter's rifle is a magnetic weapon, although an as-of-yet unknown material used in its barrel provides a substantial increase to the kinetic projectiles' velocity without the added requirement of additional power that would normally accompany such an improvement.\n\nCritical to the weapon's effectiveness is an advanced targeting system integrated into the rifle's scope, which I discovered to be independently powered by one of the smallest Elerium-based power cells I have ever encountered. And while I have no doubt that the Hunter was a skilled marksman in his own right, I am equally confident that the ballistic computer provided here will make even the most average among our troops look heroic. -R. Tygan." 

[ChosenWarlockWeapons X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Warlock Weapon"
Summary="Despite a primary reliance on powerful Psionic attacks, the Chosen Warlock does fall back on an unusual rifle unlike any wielded by the more conventional forces of ADVENT. Our soldiers will no doubt be eager to try this new trophy."
CodeName="Ersatz"
LongDescription="The Elders' Chosen Warlock, perhaps their most powerful Psionic command unit, fielded a number of potent abilities to gain physical control over those he was sent to pursue. However, as with most who find themselves in the throes of battle, when all else failed, the Warlock would return to the conventional and strike with this relatively nondescript rifle.\n\nDespite an increase in size owing to the Chosen's physical stature, the weapon itself is deceptively light in weight and delicate in balance. Although it would appear to fire the standard ADVENT round, there is an unexplained variance in effective range that I can so far only attribute to an unknown material lining the weapon's barrel.\n\nAlthough it is unlikely we would be able to accurately replicate the weapon in its entirety, I have authorized continued field trials to the indulgence of our troops. Even if the results yield no further research benefit, they will no doubt enjoy turning this weapon against the aliens who crafted it. -R. Tygan."
