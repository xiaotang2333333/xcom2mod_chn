SpokenText="Commander, we'll need to recover that body for Dr. Tygan to study. Someone's gonna have to haul it back to the rendezvous point for EVAC to the Avenger."

[T_Support_Carry_Soldier_Recover_Loot_Central AkEvent]
SpokenText="Commander, if we don't carry the body of our fallen soldier to the rendezvous point, we'll lose whatever gear they had on them. Carrying a body will reduce the combat effectiveness of one of our soldiers, but that's the only way we can recover that equipment. The choice is yours."

[T_Support_Carry_Unconscious_Soldier_Central AkEvent]
SpokenText="Commander, one of our soldiers is unconscious. If we can't revive them in the field, we'll have to carry them back to the rendezvous point for EVAC."

[T_Support_Evac_Attempt_Incomplete_Objective AkEvent]
SpokenText="Commander, we have units in position to EVAC, but we haven't completed the mission objective. If we abandon the site now, we'll lose our chance here."

[T_Support_First_Advent_Tower_Spotted_Central AkEvent]
SpokenText="Commander, our specialists should be able to hack into the ADVENT security towers, but we'll need to be careful about moving our other forces nearby if we want to avoid detection."

[T_Support_Forge_Mission_Intro_Central AkEvent]
SpokenText="Commander, Tygan and Shen have completed their analysis of the Blacksite vial, but before we can move in on the coordinates encoded in its base, we'll need to make contact with the local resistance forces in the region."

[T_Support_Psi_Gate_Mission_Intro_Central AkEvent]
SpokenText="Commander, Shen has confirmed we have the coordinates from the Codex last known position, but we'll need to contact the local resistance forces in the region to coordinate our investigation of the site."

[T_Support_Reminder_Knock_Out_VIP_Central_01 AkEvent]
SpokenText="Menace 1-5, remember, we're here to capture the VIP if possible. Knock 'em out and bring 'em in."

[T_Support_Reminder_Shoot_Escaping_VIP_Central_01 AkEvent]
SpokenText="Menace 1-5, if we can't bring the target in alive, eliminate them. We can't let 'em escape."

[T_Support_Reminder_Soldier_Bleeding_Out_Central_01 AkEvent]
SpokenText="We've gotta get that soldier some help before they bleed out. Stabilize them with a medikit, or call in an EVAC and carry 'em to the extraction point. They won't last much longer without support."

[T_Tactical_Callouts_Resistance_Central_01 AkEvent]
SpokenText="The resistance managed to recover and restore a handful of these mobile communications jammers over the years. With a few makeshift repairs, these things have proven invaluable to the resistance effort."

[T_Tactical_Callouts_Resistance_Central_02 AkEvent]
SpokenText="The resistance has done everything it can to convince people to join the cause, but it's an uphill battle when you've got ADVENT whispering propaganda in your ear 24 hours a day."

[T_Tactical_Callouts_Resistance_Central_03 AkEvent]
SpokenText="I'm glad to see the resistance has their new recruits training, they need to be prepared for the next ADVENT sweep of this area."

[T_Terror_Narrative_Wrappers_01 AkEvent]
SpokenText="Now that we've got the aliens attention, they're taking it out on one of the resistance outposts in this area. We're heading in to secure the camp and protect as many civilians as we can. Eliminate all hostile forces attacking the site, make 'em regret coming after the resistance."

[T_Terror_Narrative_Wrappers_02 AkEvent]
SpokenText="ADVENT's so-called peacekeepers are hitting one of the resistance camps in this area, and they're taking out civilians and fighters alike. We're deploying to protect as many people as we can. Secure the site and take out any hostile forces still threatening the area."

[T_Unique_Missions_Blacksite_Central_01 AkEvent]
SpokenText="Our contacts in the local resistance have shown us how to access the ADVENT Blacksite. The aliens worked hard to keep this place under the radar, and we don't know what we're gonna find in there. Keep your heads up, expect heavy opposition."

[T_Unique_Missions_Forge_Central_01 AkEvent]
SpokenText="As far as we can tell, this Forge is some sort of alien production facility, most likely tied to that stuff we found at the Blacksite. ADVENT and the alien forces won't be happy to see us, so expect heavy resistance. We have to do whatever it takes to find out what's going on in there."

[T_Unique_Missions_Psi_Gate_Central_01 AkEvent]
SpokenText="Shen and Tygan barely managed to pull these coordinates from that "Codex" thing they had down in the Shadow Chamber. We're guessing this may be its origin point, but can't know for sure. Based on the fight it put up, I'd expect heavy resistance either way. Good luck down there."

[T_Unique_Missions_Terror_Attack_Central_01 AkEvent]
