Alright, settle down out there, this isn't funny. A lot of good people in the Resistance lost it today, and the aliens are going to make a HUGE deal about how they crushed the dissident threat...but don't let it get you down, we're closer than ever to kicking them the hell off our planet. -> 好吧，大家找个地方坐下，我有个沉重的消息要宣布。今天反抗军的许多好人献出了自己的生命，外星人估计会大肆宣传他们对叛乱分子取得的胜利...但请大家不要因此灰心丧气，我们就快把他们从我们的星球赶出去了。

Although <XGParam:StrValue1/!FirstName/> was born in <XGParam:StrValue0/!CountryName/> and spent much of her time working in solitude, during a brief introductory period she served as a colleague of Dr. Tygan's at one of ADVENT's earliest gene therapy clinics. -> 虽然<XGParam:StrValue1/!FirstName/>出生于<XGParam:StrValue0/!CountryName/>，大部分时间独自工作，但刚入行的一小段时间里她曾与泰根博士一道在变种人最早成立的一家基因治疗诊所中工作过。
Although <XGParam:StrValue1/!FirstName/> was born in <XGParam:StrValue0/!CountryName/> and spent much of his time working in solitude, during a brief introductory period he served as a colleague of Dr. Tygan's at one of ADVENT's earliest gene therapy clinics. -> 虽然<XGParam:StrValue1/!FirstName/>出生于<XGParam:StrValue0/!CountryName/>，大部分时间独自工作，但刚入行的一小段时间里他曾与泰根博士一道在变种人最早成立的一家基因治疗诊所中工作过。
Although ADVENT clearly intended for these units to be their means of dealing with any unruly civilians within the city centers, it seems they've come to rely on more brutal means of pacification in the time since. -> 尽管变种人想靠这些来对付城市中心的平民们，但似乎越来越依靠残忍暴行的方式来追求和平。
Although ADVENT conducts regular patrols throughout the region, pockets of Resistance in the area remain. We reached out to the local Resistance sources, and they pointed out several buildings nearby that they've been stashing contraband in. They offered up what they could spare. -> 尽管变种人在该地区会进行定期的巡逻，但这里还存在着零星的反抗军。我们与当地的反抗军碰头，他们指出了几个他们储藏违禁品的建筑物，给了我们他们所能提供的东西。
Although I had realistic expectations as to the limited resources and facilities available to me onboard the Avenger, I have to say, it's taken some getting used to. Even with the ship's dampening field, frequent turbulence, and the occasional evasive maneuver, make it difficult to conduct experiments of any notable sensitivity. I may have to adapt my research techniques to maintain efficiency under these conditions. -> 虽然我在登上复仇者号时对可利用的有限资源以及设施做了理性的评估，但是我得承认，还是需要有一个适应的过程。船上的抑制场，频繁的震动--以及间歇性规避策略--都会加大我敏感性试验的难度。我必须在这种环境下调整研究技术以保持试验的有效性。
Although I respect the effort your team put forth, Commander, with that facility still intact the aliens will continue their work on the Avatar Project unabated. -> 尽管我很感激你的军队的努力，指挥官。但外星人设施没有被摧毁，他们仍然可以继续进行化身计划的研究。
Although I was extremely hesitant to perform an autopsy on this creature before an extensive analysis of the fumes vented with regularity from its suit, my concerns were overruled by the rest of the senior staff due to our overbearing time constraints. It was with some relief that I discovered the most common element to be Argon, an otherwise harmless gas when handled properly. Although similar in size and physical structure to the Muton species, the \"Andromedon\" as it's come to be known does not appear to be of the same genetic design as the Muton. I stress design here because perhaps more so than all but the most extreme examples, the Andromedon was engineered to exist only within the confines of the environmental suit we see them wearing in the field. Destruction of this protective equipment results in a reaction similar to what we might see if a human astronaut were to remove their helmet in space - that is to say, a painful and unpleasant death within minutes. R. Tygan. -> 尽管在对这个生物的护甲散发出来的烟做全面分析以前，我很犹豫是否要对它做解剖，因为时间紧迫我的顾虑还是被别的高级工作人员给否决了。当知道气体中大多成分是氩气时我就稍稍放心了一些，因为只要正当操作这种气体对人无害。虽然大小以及身体结构和异变者都很相似，\"仙女座外星人\"这一名称就让我们感到在基因设计上就会和异变者不同。我在这里强调设计是因为，我就举一个最极端的例子，仙女座外星人只有穿着我们在战场上看到的那种环境服中才能存活。如果毁坏这件保护用的装备的话，我们将会看到类似这样的一个场景：一个人类宇航员在太空中要摘除头盔--也就是说，他们会在数分钟内非常痛苦地死去。理查德·泰根。
Although I would expect to be more growing accustomed to seeing the clear intermingling of both human and alien genetic material, I must admit, this reptilian creature with such distinctive human features is surprisingly unsettling. Invasion-era reports include references to a species with some reptilian qualities, but nothing as readily apparent as this. -> 尽管我应该要对混合人类和外星基因的东西更习惯了，但我必须承认，这种还带有明显人类特征的爬虫生物十分让人不安。侵略时期的报告包括了一种有爬虫特质的生物，但没有什么跟这个一样明显。
Although I'm impressed with the strides we've made in infiltrating the alien Psionic network, the depths of their technological advancement continue to leave us one step behind. -> 尽管我们潜入外星人灵能网络的进展不错，但其技术发展水平还是领先我们一步。
Although conceptually the idea of establishing a radio-based communications system for the purposes of organizing a Resistance movement is nothing new, harkening back to any number of Earth's previous wars, what we hope to accomplish here is still no small task. The aliens are particularly adept at detecting our signals, with a vast array of technology and resources at their disposal. However, working in close collaboration with Chief Engineer Shen, we've begun to salvage some of the aliens' own communications equipment from within the Avenger itself. From studying the surviving log files, we've discovered an astounding number of simultaneous communications being distributed through their network at any given time. This has proven to be the key to our proposed solution; with so much traffic flowing through the alien network, it should be relatively easy for us to disguise our own transmissions among theirs. Using the Avenger as our central hub, we can establish a communications network linking Resistance outposts around the globe. Every new contact we establish should organize and strengthen the movement as a whole. R. Tygan. -> 建立以无线电为基础的通讯网络以组织反抗军的行动，这个想法已不再新鲜。然而追溯到过去地球上的任何一场战争，我们就会发现现在要完成的并非易事。外星人特别善于利用手上的大量技术和资源监测我们的信号，但是通过我与沈总工程师的通力合作，我们开始回收利用一些外星人的通讯设备而不局限于复仇者号自己的设施。通过研究现存的日志，我们发现外星人在任何时间的通讯量都是令人震惊的。这一点为我们解决问题提供了关键信息：既然外星网络有着这么大的流量，我们在他们的传输中掩盖自己的通信应该不难。把复仇者号作为中心，我们能够建立起连接全球反抗军前哨站的通讯网络。我们建立的每一个新的联络都可以组织并加强整个行动。理查德·泰根。
Although designed primarily to support their Psionic amplifiers, the Templar armor does provide sufficient protection from light attacks. -> 尽管设计的初衷是为了辅助他们的灵能强化装置的功效，圣殿骑士护甲依旧能够有效地抵御轻度攻击。
Although evidence of post-invasion settlements still exist throughout this region, the area is devoid of life. Relying on the Avenger's main computer to triangulate likely positions of salvageable resources, we located a few supplies scattered throughout the nearby structures. -> 尽管被侵略后还有人住在这里，大部分的区域已经渺无人烟了。我们用复仇者号的中央计算机测算了可回收资源的大致位置，还是在附近找到了一些补给品。
Although it is unfortunate you were unable to secure additional resources during your raid in <XGParam:StrValue0/!WorldRegionName/>, Commander, I am confident that you will find alternative means to supply your operations. -> 很遗憾您未能在<XGParam:StrValue0/!WorldRegionName/>行动中获得额外的物资，指挥官，但我相信以您的能力一定可以找到新的物资来源。
Although it was a time-intenstive process, I was able to successfully decrypt the ADVENT data recovered by our troops in the field. As expected, the information includes the exact coordinates for one of ADVENT's remote facilities. With this knowledge in hand, we should be able to deploy a strike team to infiltrate and destroy the facility. I have no doubts that the loss of this site will deal a significant blow to the aliens' efforts towards the Avatar Project. R. Tygan. -> 尽管耗时长久，我最终还是成功破解了我军从战场收集的变种人数据。如我所料，数据揭示了一处偏远地区的变种人设施坐标。我们可以组织一次突袭，潜入并捣毁这个设施。相信这样一来，外星人的化身计划会遭受相当大的打击。理查德·泰根。
Although it would almost appear to mimic the design of traditional revolvers found on Earth, the technology involved here is anything but conventional. -> 尽管它的造型看上去几乎跟地球上的左轮手枪没两样，其中运用的科技可完全是跟传统搭不着边。
Although it would appear to be humanoid in form, this entity is nearly invisible to our sensors. Had I not seen it myself, I would question its very existence. -> 虽然它看上去是人形的，但其实体几乎无法被感应器探测到。要不是亲眼所见，我甚至连它是否存在都没法确定。
Although my followers are focused on enhancing their power, we do not shun the advances of technology if it means furthering our cause. We will gladly share our knowledge with those likeminded in purpose. -> 虽然我的追随者更痴迷于增强他们的灵能，但只要能为我们带来优势，我们也不会拒绝科技的进步。我们很乐意与战友分享我们的知识。
Although our Heavy armor suits are already a formidable protective enhancement for our troops, with some additional reinforcements and a few mounting points, it's possible we could equip even more advanced wrist-mounted weaponry capable of decimating enemy positions. -> 虽然我们的重型护甲已经能为士兵们提供可观的防护能力，但要是再进行一些强化并加装几个武器挂载点，就可以装备更先进的手腕挂载式武器，以摧毁敌方阵地。
Although our early plasma weapon designs have already proven successful, further refinements and adaptations of the alien technology could lead to a weapon capable of destroying cover in the field. -> 虽然我们早期的电浆武器设计被证明是成功的，但如果用外星技术进一步改造和加强的话，我们将造出在战场上有毁灭性能的武器。
Although physically similar to the Archon units we've encountered in the past, our troops quickly discovered that this unusual variant has a propensity for physical attacks, carrying and then dropping unsuspecting victims from extreme heights. -> 尽管同我们之前遇到的执政官在形体上很相似，我们的军队很快发现，这种变体倾向于使用肉体攻击，将受害者举到极高处再扔下来。
Although rumors of XCOM dissidents operating inside the city centers continue to spread, citizens are reminded that collaboration with enemy combatants is a capital offense.  -> 尽管关于XCOM在市中心里采取行动的流言还在传播，但是对市民们来说，通敌是死罪。
Although similar in appearance to the Psionic zombies we have encountered previously in our engagements with the aliens, all current indications are that these "Lost" are the product of something else entirely. -> 虽然失魂者跟我们之前和外星人的冲突中所遭遇的灵能僵尸在外貌上有一定的相似之处，所有证据都表明这些\"失魂者\"完全是灵能以外的事物造成的产物。
Although similar in appearance to the Psionic zombies we have encountered previously in our engagements with the aliens, all current indications are that these Lost are the product of something else entirely. Prolonged exposure to the chemical agents first released in the earliest stages of the invasion seem to have turned these once innocent civilians into yet another form of the undead. -> 虽然失魂者跟我们之前和外星人的冲突中所遭遇的灵能僵尸在外型上有一定的相似之处，所有证据都表明这些失魂者完全是灵能以外的事物造成的产物。在外星人入侵的初期受这些化学物质影响至今使这些曾今的不知情的市民变成了又一种活尸。
Although the Avenger is now a fully operational headquarters for XCOM, many areas of the ship are still crowded with alien debris and other leftover equipment from the ship's previous occupants. To clear debris, assign an unstaffed Engineer to a debris filled room. Once cleared, these areas can be used to build additional facilities better suited to XCOM's purposes. -> 尽管复仇者号现在由XCOM全权所有，是一座功能齐全运转得当的总部，但实际这艘飞船上还有不少地方被前主人留下的外星残骸与装备堆得满满的。你可以指派工程师前往这样的区域进行整理挖掘，清理好的区域可以用来建造额外设施，提升XCOM的综合实力。
Although the Avenger is still far from being flight-ready, the ship has already become something of a hub for the early resistance movement. With both a professional and personal connection to the Avenger, Lily Shen has taken on the role of \"facilitator,\" gathering resources and supplies to keep the ship in top condition until the day finally comes when she can fly again. -> 虽然复仇者号离起飞还早得很，但这艘飞船已经成为了早期反抗军活动的基地。莉莉·沈对这艘飞船有着特殊的感情，她勇敢地承担起 \"协调者\"的角色，积极地收集资源和补给，让复仇者号保持在最佳状态，争取早日让它重新在天空中翱翔。
Although the Elders' Chosen had hoped to ambush your soldiers, Commander, your quick work ensured the safe return of all those loyal to the Resistance. -> 尽管长老的天选者企图伏击你的士兵，指挥官，但你快速的应对让这些忠诚的战士安全回到了反抗军。
Although the Reapers object to the use of alien technology in principle, we have assured them that beam weaponry under development here is of our own design. Regardless of their objections, the energy-based Vektor rifle is without question superior to any past variant they have ever wielded. -> 死神在原则上是拒绝使用外星科技的，但我们已经向他们保证这种光束武器是完全由我们自主研发的产物。虽然死神对能量武器不屑一顾，但这类武器毫无疑问要比他们过去使用的传统武器要强。
Although the Resistance is spread across regions around the world, the largest factions represent the core strengths of our cause. Each is offering to help us in unique operations to fight back against ADVENT. The choice of what to pursue is yours, Commander. -> 虽然世界上到处都是反抗势力，但规模最大的派系还是我们。每个派系都愿意协助我们对抗变种人。要接受哪个派系的帮助由你决定，指挥官。
Although the Russian military fought tooth and nail to defend their prized capital of Moscow, as their international counterparts discovered, Resistance merely delayed the inevitable. -> 尽管俄军拼死拼活来防御他们宝贵的首都莫斯科，但正如他们的国际同仁一样，抵抗也只不过是在推迟他们不可避免的失败罢了。
Although the Sectoids have changed substantially since the invasion, their ability to manipulate Psionic energy has clearly not been diminished in the process. With a complete study of this new specimen, we may be able to develop the Psionic capabilities of our own troops. -> 尽管灰人自从入侵战争以来发生了显著的改变，他们还是保有了优秀的灵能操控力。若能彻底研究这一新样本，或许可以提高我方军队的灵能能力。
Although the aliens apparently never created a long-range variant of their own plasma rifle design, that doesn't preclude us from experimenting with the concept. There are several issues we'll have to overcome, but the challenge is intriguing. -> 尽管外星人显然从未在电浆步枪设计的基础上研制出远程改良型，这并不妨碍我们继续这方面的研究。目前我们需要攻克几个难关，但挑战令人着迷。
Although the logistical concerns involved in transporting a large piece of potentially unstable alien technology were difficult to manage, they are easily dwarfed by the risks involved in attempting to operate this device within the confines of the Avenger. Although Shen and I both had our concerns, given the directives of our operation, we saw little alternative but to begin experimenting on this Gateway as soon as possible.\n\nAfter a period of slow, deliberate power increases accompanied by the appropriate level of monitoring, we felt comfortable enough to leave the Gateway operating in its idle state. At that point, we conducted a series of simple tests on various objects to better understand how the aliens use the device for transportation. Initially, we saw no means of actually putting the Gateway into an active state. That is to say, the Gateway itself seemed to disregard or ignore the objects we passed through.\n\nHaving studied the alien Codex and its ability to open rifts in the field for deployment, we theorized the Gateway may be tied to a similar signal or key integrated into the Codex itself. Sure enough, by mirroring the frequencies found in close proximity to the Codex, we found that the Gateway itself enters a second, active condition.\n\nShen was hesitant to relegate her pet GREMLIN to use in our experiment, but she recognized the value in having a remote test subject, and we had no other units available to spare. Unfortunately, our initial theories as to the Gateway's function overlooked the possibility that it was also tied to the biological components of the Codex. Shen's personal GREMLIN suffered some relatively minor damage during our test, but its sacrifice led to an important revelation in terms of how we might access this Gateway and discover its source. R. Tygan. -> 尽管后勤部门担心运输这么大一块具有潜在不稳定性的外星人科技很困难，但是他们的这种担心与试图在复仇者号内部运行这个装置所具有的风险相比就显得相形见绌了。虽然沈博士和我都很担心，鉴于我们行动的指示，我们找不到其它的替代方式，只能在这个通道里尽快进行试验。\n\n在经过了一段时间缓慢而又谨慎的能量增加还有适当的控制之后，我们觉得是时候离开让通道运行在它的理想状态。在那个阶段，我们对很多目标进行了一系列简单的测试，想要更好地理解外星人是怎样运用这个装置进行运输的。首先，我们想不出办法让这个通道进入激活状态。也就是说，通道看上去不理或忽视我们穿过去的东西。\n\n在研究了外星人原典和他能在地上打开裂痕用来部署兵力的能力后，我们推理通道也许和类似的信号或者钥匙相关联。果真，通过通道与原典近距离接触反映出来的频率来看，我们发现通道自己进入了第二个激活状态。\n\n沈博士很不情愿把她自己的小精灵宠物提交用来实验，但是她意识到进行一项远程测试项目会很有价值，再加上我们也没有其他可用的单位。不幸的是，我们最初关于通道功能的理论忽视了它与原典在生物成分上也有联系的可能性。她的小精灵在我们实验期间遭受了些相对小型的伤害，但是它的牺牲给予了我们有关如何进入通道并且发现它源头的重要启示。理查德·泰根。
Although they bear some resemblance to the Sectoids first encountered during the invasion, their genetic structure now includes human DNA. They're stronger than ever, with an even greater psionic potential. -> 尽管他们和我们在入侵时首次遭遇到的灰人有相似之处，但现在他们的基因结构中包含了人类的DNA。还有了更强的灵能潜力，而且更强壮了。

Among the aliens' more reclusive forces, the ADVENT unit we've come to identify as the \"Priest\" has recently become a regular sighting for our forces deployed in the field. These Priests apparently wield a great deal of power over their subordinate ADVENT units, relying on Psionic control to issue orders and exert their will in battle.\n\nWhile their physical appearance is no more striking than that of a typical ADVENT soldier, their talents in wielding Psionic energy clearly differentiates them from the standard hybrid unit. Based on my post-mortem examination, I believe the source of this increased proficiency comes from careful genetic manipulation, a hallmark of the Elders' forces. In this case, an unusual synaptic configuration allows for what I believe to be Psionic transduction between otherwise distinct and unrelated cell types found throughout the body.\n\nIn combat, these increased pathways for the storage and release of Psionic energy allow the Priest to project control over its enemies in the field, while bolstering the survivability of its allies. Perhaps most critically, the Priest has been known to sustain its own life force through Psionic manipulation, cheating death in a way not seen among the Elders' other subordinate alien races. In the interest of preserving our troops' lives, I've made this particular skill the focus of my research going forward. -R. Tygan. -> 被我们称为\"祭司\"的变种人单位本是较为罕见的，最近却越来越经常地与我们的部队在战场上短兵相接。这些祭司很显然拥有一定的权力，能够通过灵能对手下的变种人下达命令、部署战术。\n\n尽管它们的外表比起普通的变种人士兵并没有什么突出之处，但其强大的灵能力才是它们与那些外星混血士兵最大的区别。根据我的尸检结果，我认为它们的灵能来自于细致的基因操作，这也是长老最擅长的手腕。它们身体中大部分细胞都很寻常，但不同寻常的是它们的突触结构，显著提升了它们的灵能传导效率。\n\n在战斗中，这些为强化及大量储存灵能设计的细胞结构让它们能够控制战场上的敌人并保障友军的生命安全。更重要的是，能让它们通过灵能来维持自己的生命，这可是其他长老的部下没法做到的事。为提升我们士兵的存活率，我已经将这项能力划为了将来的研究重点。 - 理查德·泰根
Among the last of the holdouts in this area, a small group of Resistance fighters, known as the Fire Axis, made contact while we were scanning the region.

An inherently terrifying and unpleasant species to encounter by surprise, I can only admire our troops for their courage in dealing with the species known as the \"Chryssalid.\" Mirroring the general form of a common Arthropod, immediately noticeable is the sleek, armored exoskeleton protecting its segmented body. Of particular concern for our troops are the honed points of the Chryssalid's fangs and legs, capable of inflicting critical injuries on their own, they also allow for the creature's gruesome means of rapid reproduction in the field.\n\nAlthough Central Officer Bradford insists that he witnessed a different, equally invasive means of Chryssalid gestation during the earliest days of the war, there is no evidence that such attacks still occur today. Unfortunately, from what he's described, I would say the aliens have actually evolved the process into a more efficient, and deadly, solution. The Chryssalids we see today inject a venom that immediately begins softening the structure of the victim's internal organs, preparing the subject to serve as a both the material for a gestation cocoon, and as a ready supply of nutrients for the Chryssalid young. Should the victim fail to receive medical support and expire, the cocoon will form shortly thereafter. Assuming the cocoon is not destroyed during the initial gestation period, we can expect up to three Chryssalid young to emerge after an impressively short period of growth.\n\nRecent reports from the field indicate some form of "burrowing" behavior, perhaps another evolution of past techniques, in this case likely for defensive purposes. Our troops would be well-advised to watch where they step in the future. R. Tygan. -> \"寄生兽\"是一种你完全不想碰见的恐怖物种，我对任何有勇气面对它们士兵表示由衷的敬意。寄生兽形态与普通节肢动物相似，最引人注目的是它光滑坚硬的外骨骼，用来保护它分段式的身体。我们士兵最担心的就是它尖利的獠牙和长腿，能够造成严重的伤势，还有它在战场上迅速的繁殖能力。\n\n尽管军事中心长官布拉德福德坚称他在战争初期看到过寄生兽另一种同样令人毛骨悚然的繁殖方法，没有证据显示这种方法至今仍然存在。不幸的是，根据他的说法，我相信实际上外星人是把这种方法进一步完善得更有效率且更致命。我们今天所见的寄生兽可以注射毒液，立刻软化受害者的内脏，好把受害者转化为幼虫的茧以及食物。如果受害者不立刻受到医药救治，茧就会形成。如果茧在初期没有被毁灭的话，至少会有三只寄生兽在极短的时间内孵化出来。\n\n近期的实地报告显示有些寄生兽甚至开始有\"遁地\"行为，这或许又是一种新进化出的防御手段。我们的士兵在未来上战场之前必须谨记这点。理查德·泰根。

Apparently the resistance has been relying on an old data tap along the ADVENT network that had, up until this point, been eluding the aliens' detection. Recent Intel suggests the data the resistance found is critical to the aliens' latest operation. Unfortunately ADVENT is already moving to take it out the device, and we can't let that happen. Eliminate all hostile contacts and secure the area. Protect that device at all costs. -> 反抗军在变种人网络上的一个老旧的数据点到现在都没有被外星人发现。最新情报显示反抗军找到的这份数据与外星人本次行动息息相关。可惜变种人已经准备要摧毁它了，我们不会坐视不理。消灭所有接触到的敌人并确保该地区的安全，不惜一切代价保护设备。

These policy cards allow for a variety of different Faction-specific orders to be issued. As our influence continues to grow, so will our ability to issue new orders unlocking additional policy cards as well as increasing the number of slots to implement them with. -> 随着XCOM在反抗军派系中的影响力上升，我们可以通过使用议事厅设施的政策卡来指引这些派系。使用这些政策卡以发布派系中各种不同的命令。影响力越高，可下达的命令就越丰富，还能解锁额外的政策卡以及增加实施命令的槽位。
As XCOM successfully completes various operations and tasks for the Resistance, additional Scientists and Engineers will join the crew to further your efforts. These new recruits can be assigned to facilities or various tasks to aid XCOM's work. -> 随着XCOM为反抗军完成了各式各样的行动，越来越多的工程师和科学家会加入XCOM，为我们效力。你可以将他们分配到总部的设施工作，或是派他们执行任务。

As allies, I must call upon your help to aid my followers. -> 身为你的友军，我请求你支援我的追随者。
As far as I can tell, ADVENT's technology, along with most of what we've seen going on in the city centers, is based on variations, and in some cases improvements, of the existing alien tech used during the invasion. Luckily, the more common this stuff becomes, the easier it'll be for us to find components that can work in conjunction with the Avenger's hybrid systems. -> 就目前我所知，变种人的技术以及我们在市中心所看到的一切都是基于变异，而在一些案例中，是根据在侵略中已使用的外星技术加以改进。幸运的是，这些物质越普通，对我们找到可以在复仇者号的动力系统中使用的部件就越容易。
As far as we can tell, someone has been smuggling information out of the ADVENT network using one of their data vaults. The signal we picked up is faint, but there's definitely something down there. ADVENT is already in position for their own recovery effort, so expect hostile resistance. Secure the site and locate the vault in question. Leave no enemy standing. -> 根据目前我们了解的情况，有人在用变种人的数据库向变种人网络外偷偷发送信息。我们获取的信号很微弱，但是那里肯定发生了什么事。变种人已经开始进行修复行动，很可能会与我们遭遇。肃清这个地点并找到有问题的数据库。不要留下任何一个敌人。
As far as we can tell, this Forge is some sort of alien production facility, most likely tied to that stuff we found at the Blacksite. ADVENT and the alien forces won't be happy to see us, so expect heavy resistance. We have to do whatever it takes to find out what's going on in there. -> 目前来看，这个锻造厂应该是某种外星制造设施，和我们在黑地找到的东西有些关系。变种人和外星部队不会欢迎我们的，肯定会有大量敌军驻扎。我们必须不惜一切代价找出真相。
As if people in the cities weren't brainwashed enough, who knows what the aliens are putting in their heads for entertainment. -> 就算城市里的人还没有被完全洗脑，那谁知道那些外星人只是为了好玩就往他们脑袋里灌输了什么呢。
As if the Skulljack itself wasn't invasive enough, Tygan has conceived of a more thorough means of extracting information from ADVENT soldiers' chips. This new \"Skullmining\" technique could lead to new intel gains from our enemies, and could even grant access to hidden Alien facilities for the purpose of sabotage. I can also upgrade our Skulljacks to significantly enhance the hacking ability of any soldier carrying one. -> 泰根博士可能觉得头颅接入器的侵入性还不算很强，他设想出一个从变种人士兵的芯片中更彻底地提取出信息的方法。这个新的\"头颅开采器\"技术能使我们从敌军获取新的情报，甚至能够使我们能够获得进入隐藏的外星人设施进行破坏的机会。另外，我可以升级头颅接入器，让携带它的士兵的入侵能力显著提升。
As if the aliens didn't have enough annoying spokespeople, now we have these Chosen running around lecturing us day and night. -> 外星人本来就天天搞宣传战像个苍蝇一样烦人，然后现在他们还让这些天选者到处做演讲。
As if the typical Muton wasn't aggressive enough, this hulking beast seems dangerous even in death. I will more than happy to dispose of it once I file my report. -> 典型的异变者并不具有太多攻击性，但这个笨重的野兽即使死了看起来也相当危险。我宁愿填好报告就马上扔掉它。
As if they weren't bad enough, one of the Chosen has increased in power. -> 有个天选者的力量提升了，搞得他们好像之前不强似的。
As if things weren't bad enough between the Elders, their alien armies, and the Chosen... now we've got zombies to deal with. -> 处理长老、外星人军队、天选者本来就够我们忙活的了...现在又冒出来了这种僵尸。
As initially speculated by Shen, it does in fact appear that this creature is restricted to the confines of its own hulking environmental suit. Unfortunately for our troops, the suit itself is a powerful physical threat regardless of the operator's status, as we learned with some astonishment in the field. -> 正如一开始沈猜测的一样，这种生物确实被它巨大的环境套甲所限制。不幸的是，从战地经验中我们知道这套甲对我们的士兵而言本身就是一个强大的形体威胁，不管它里面的人状态如何。
As is usually the case, our troops came up with the designation for this particular subject, currently known as the \"Shieldbearer.\" Initial indications are that it is tactically on-par with ADVENT's other humanoid field units, with no particular mental or physical advantages over the Officers or other units. The primary difference seems to lie in the armor suit itself, which is heavily reinforced with multiple layers of composite material woven from what I can only surmise to be some variation of the alien alloys. I intend on leaving the metallurgy and structural analysis to Shen and her team, who will no doubt find a means of integrating her findings into various experimental armor concepts of our own. R. Tygan. -> 如往常一样，我们的部队在战场遇到了这么一个兵种，目前被称为\"持盾者\"。最初的迹象表明，其在战术上与变种人其他没有特殊的精神和身体优势的地面单位相类似。最基本的差别看上去在于护甲本身，这些部队有着厚重加强的护甲，有多层复合材料，我推测这是一种外星合金的变体。我希望沈和她的团队能够对其进行冶金学和结构学的分析，他们一定能够通过研究将其整合进我们自己的装甲制造理念中去。理查德·泰根。
As it was fated, I am the last of my kind, the one true Chosen. There will be no further distractions, your reckoning is at hand! -> 和我预见的一样，我现在是最后的天选者，真正的天选者了。没有什么能够再阻碍我，你的末日就快到了！
As long as there's even one Reaper left standing, you can bet they're still in the fight, finger on the trigger. -> 只要还有一位死神站着，他们就仍旧会准备好死战。
As long as you've been chipped first? -> 但是首先你要被植入芯片？
As much as I dislike taking home prisoners, who am I to pass up a valuable source of information. -> 虽然我不喜欢把俘虏带回总部，但要是错过了宝贵的情报就亏大了。
As much as I have enjoyed our battles, the Elders patience with you is at an end, Commander. You have come to our sanctuary, and now you will complete your ascension to the Elder's side. -> 虽然我很享受我们之间的战斗，但长老对你的耐心已经耗尽了，指挥官。既然你胆敢闯入我们的圣所，那就干脆乖乖归顺长老吧。
As much as I love being two steps ahead of everyone Commander, I was almost hoping we wouldn't find ourselves having this little chat today. Your people have managed to keep things interesting, but it all ends now. -> 虽然一般情况下我更喜欢占据优势地位，指挥官，但我其实心里面不大乐意跟你碰面。你们让整件事变得不那么无聊，可惜的是，一切都将到此为止。
As much as I love being two steps ahead of everyone, Commander, I was almost hoping we wouldn't be having this little chat today. Your people have managed to keep things interesting, but it all ends now. -> 虽然一般情况下我更喜欢占据优势地位，指挥官，但我其实心里面不大乐意跟你碰面。你们让整件事变得不那么无聊，可惜的是，一切都将到此为止。
As often as we send our people into the field, it's not unusual that they'll come back nearly exhausted from combat. I'd advise we give our tired soldiers a few days rest before sending them back out, their performance is only going to suffer otherwise. -> 我们虽然经常派遣士兵执行任务，但他们会累成这样实属罕见。我建议让疲惫的士兵休息几天再出任务，不然他们的战斗效率只会显著下降。
As one dies, another is already born to take its place. -> 死了一个变种人，马上就会有新的替代品。
As one of the Elders Chosen, I transcend your understanding of death. -> 身为长老的天选者，死亡这一概念对我是不适用的。
As one of the other Chosen returns to the Elders, I am empowered to honor their sacrifice. You will be returned, Commander. -> 天选者中的一人回到了长老的身边，而我也因此有了为他们复仇的动力。我一定会把你带回长老身边的，指挥官。
As our technology has continued to evolve in lock-step with our understanding of the aliens' own designs, it should now be possible to fabricate even more powerful weaponry for our heavy armor suits. -> 随着我们技术稳步发展，以及对外星设计的理解加深，现在我们应该可以为我们重型护甲制造出更强力的武器了。
As rigor mortis sets in, the lips of Stun Lancers invariably peel back into a garish grin, likely a reflexive result due to dangerous doses of combat stimulants taken before battle. -> 出现尸僵后，强袭枪兵的尸体无总会呈现诡异的微笑，这可能是战前过量使用战斗兴奋剂所致。
As someone who has themselves been a captive of the Elders, Commander, you should know all too well the risks you have now exposed your loyal follower to. -> 身为一个亲身体验过俘虏生活的人，指挥官，你明明知道你这位忠实的支持者会有什么遭遇，却还是把他丢了下来。
As stated previously "no". Removing these implants was never part- -> 刚才就回答说\"不\"了。从没想到还要移除这些植入物的...
As the Chosen gain knowledge of XCOM's activities, they'll have an increasing number of opportunities to hamper our operations. With enough knowledge, they will even be able to track down the Avenger and end our Resistance once and for all! -> 随着天选者获取的XCOM活动情报的增多，他们会越来越频繁地阻挠我们的行动。一旦获取了足够的情报，他们便能够追踪到复仇者号并企图终结我们的反抗军！
As the Elders ask, so do I obey. You were fools to come here, and now we will face each other one last time. -> 我将贯彻长老的所有意志。既然你们真的蠢到来这里，那就让我们进行最终的决战吧。
As the Elders will it, the full wrath of ADVENT swarms upon our enemy. They can no longer hide in the shadows. The light of the Elders is upon them. -> 在长老的示意下，变种人以雷霆万钧之势对我们的敌人发动了突击。他们已经没法在藏在暗处，因为长老的圣光照的他们无处可藏。
As the Elders' vision crumbles, we will bask in their anger. -> 摧毁长老的计划后我们就将直面他们的怒火。
As the gods will it. -> 如神明所愿。
As their pain intensifies, their confidence fades away. Soon they will tell me everything, and there will be nowhere left to hide Commander.  -> 他们的痛苦在加剧，自信在消逝。很快，他们就会向我吐露一切，到时候你就无处可藏了，指挥官。
As they say, the best defense is a good offense. If we can find out what trail <XGParam:StrValue1/!ChosenName/> is following up, maybe we can throw it off your scent somehow. -> 古人说得好，最好的防守就是进攻。如果我们能发现<XGParam:StrValue1/!ChosenName/>找到了什么线索，或许我们就可以帮你甩掉他。
As they say, variety is the spice of life. -> 俗话说得好，多多益善。
As trusted allies, I ask that you aid my kind in the battle ahead. -> 作为值得信赖的盟友，我想请求你在接下来的这场战斗中给我方提供一些支援。

As with most things, we'll likely to need to bring it back to the ship for further examination. -> 从大局考虑，我们或许应该将它带回飞船进行进一步的研究分析。
As word of a growing resistance movement spreads, the Elders are increasingly desperate to find the still-grounded Avenger. During one of her field excursions, Shen is captured by a special unit of ADVENT soldiers assembled solely to hunt the Avenger. During her time in captivity, Shen learns that this ADVENT team has been taking prisoners from among the various resistance cells for some time. It's up to Central and the resurgent XCOM to save these future heroes of the resistance before it's too late. -> 随着反抗军声势的壮大，长老找到尚未起飞的复仇者号的欲望也愈发强烈。沈在一次战地行动中被一支专门为狩猎复仇者号结成的变种人小队俘虏。在俘虏期间，她发现了这支小队还从不同反抗势力中俘虏了其他战士。对于军事官和重组的XCOM来说，必须要在为时未晚之前解救这些未来的反抗军英雄。
As you serve, the Elders look on.  -> 你的服务长老们一直看在眼里。
As you wish, Commander. -> 如您所愿，指挥官。
As your fledgling Resistance crumbles, the embrace of the Elders grows ever stronger.  -> 随着你们抵抗的能力的减弱，长老对你们世界的控制则会越来越强。
Asia -> 亚洲
Aside from managing personnel, a number of resources are necessary to keep XCOM's operations running smoothly. Supplies are useful as general currency for everything from researching new tactics to purchasing items at the Black Market. Intel is necessary for establishing contact with Resistance forces. Alien Alloys and Elerium are crucial to the construction of new weapons, armor, and upgrades for our troops. -> 为了让XCOM的各项行动顺利开展，除了管理人员，还需要大量资源。补给是很有用的\"通货\"，从研究新战术到购买黑市物品，几乎可以购买到一切。情报是与反抗军部队建立联系的必需品。外星合金和超铀是为我们部队生产新武器、护甲和强化零件的重要物品。
Aside from our civic duty to rescue a fellow human in need, the only way we were going to shut down the rest of his broadcasts was if he pointed us towards the other equipment. He had been squirming for a few hours now, -> 营救DJ不仅是我们应尽的人道义务，更是我们找到剩下的广播站的唯一途径。一开始的几小时他还很不自在，
Aside from the Elders' Assassin, from what I have seen there is none other among the aliens who valued their weapon as dearly as the Chosen Hunter, and perhaps justifiably so. Visually striking for its lean, sleek appearance, this prized rifle is a testament to the aliens' true potential in refining a system down to its purest form.\n\nAt its core, the Hunter's rifle is a magnetic weapon, although an as-of-yet unknown material used in its barrel provides a substantial increase to the kinetic projectiles' velocity without the added requirement of additional power that would normally accompany such an improvement.\n\nCritical to the weapon's effectiveness is an advanced targeting system integrated into the rifle's scope, which I discovered to be independently powered by one of the smallest Elerium-based power cells I have ever encountered. And while I have no doubt that the Hunter was a skilled marksman in his own right, I am equally confident that the ballistic computer provided here will make even the most average among our troops look heroic. -R. Tygan. -> 根据我的研究，除了长老的刺客，外星人中最珍惜自己武器的就是天选者猎手了，而他的武器也值得他去珍惜。这把外观设计精巧而简洁的好枪证明了外星人将单一系统打磨到极致的真正水准。\n\n猎手的步枪本质上而言是一种磁能武器，不过它的枪管运用到了一种目前未知的材料，能够在无需提供额外能量的情况下，显著提升出膛子弹的动能。\n\n这把武器所运用的更为关键的设计是整合进瞄准镜的高级瞄准系统，里面装有我所见到过的体积最小的超铀能量电池。当然，猎人本人肯定是个神射手，这点毫无疑问，但我同样确定的是这把步枪的弹道计算机可以让我们瞄准水平不佳的士兵也能百发百中。-理查德·泰根
Aside from the variety of fascinating genetic enhancements found in the ADVENT Troopers, the Officers appear to be augmented further with some kind of biomechanical implant. I believe this allows for some form of communication throughout the alien hierarchy. If we were to somehow tap into this system, I wonder, what might we hear? -> 除了如同在变种人士兵身上发现的各种神奇的基因增强物以外，军官们好像还被某种生物机械植入物进一步增强。我认为这是用来保证在外星人阶级系统中的某种通信。假如我们打算要进入这个系统的话，我想知道，我们会听到什么呢？

As a result, a number of their most impressive tactics are centered on the capabilities of this device. -> 在脱离变种人控制后不久，散兵开发出了这种即可作为致命的突刺型武器，也可作为移动手段使用的开颅刃。他们还以这种武器为核心，发展了许多令人叹为观止的战术。

Before his rise to infamy with the Resistance Radio network, the DJ made several attempts at building a fledging radio network of his own. Piecing together a series of jerry-rigged transmitters and relays hidden near coastal towns on the fringes of ADVENT territory, the DJ piggybacked his transmission using stolen alien technology.

Before we can even begin to attempt decrypting the alien data stores, we must first come to understand the means by which they protect their most valuable data. It was immediately clear that the aliens do not rely solely on conventional algorithms, but instead use a complex matrix of interwoven biological signatures as part of the cypher itself. An additional layer of protection is afforded by an ongoing field of Psionic interference, tied directly into the ADVENT network itself. If we're to have any chance of defeating the multiple safeguards the aliens have in place, it's likely we'll have to design specialized equipment to isolate each layer of encryption before we attempt to press on with our investigation. R. Tygan. -> 在我们尝试要破解外星人数据库之前，首先需要理解他们保护最珍贵数据时使用的加密方式。我们很快就判明外星人并不单一依赖常规的加密算法，而是在编码当中加入了一个交织状生物特征的复杂矩阵。外加一层干扰灵能的持续力场保护，直接连入到变种人的网络。如果我们希望找到攻下外星人布置的多重保护的方法，我们很可能先得设计出专门的设备将两个加密层隔离开来，然后再继续我们的调查工作。理查德·泰根。

Born June 14, 2007, Taipei, Taiwan. Serving as Chief Engineer on board the Avenger, Lily Shen relies on a background consisting primarily of hands-on, practical experience learned from her father Dr. Raymond Shen. Although limited personnel records from this period still exist, what is known is that Shen and her father survived the invasion and later came to pioneer the systems and procedures necessary to rebuild the Avenger. In the time since her father's passing, the younger Shen has become invaluable to XCOM and the growing Resistance movement. She is now among the leading experts left on Earth in the field of robotics and perhaps the only one capable of integrating the alien components to such an advanced degree. -> 2007年6月14日出生于台湾省台北市。莉莉·沈是复仇者号的总工程师，其专业知识主要来源于父亲雷蒙·沈博士的言传身教。虽然保留至今的人员记录非常有限，我们所知的是莉莉·沈和她父亲在入侵中幸存下来，随后主导了重建复仇者号的必要系统和程序工作。父亲去世后，莉莉·沈成为XCOM和日益壮大的反抗军不可或缺的角色。现在她是地球上机器人技术方面的高级专家之一，而且可能是唯一能把外星零件整合到如此先进程度的人。
Born May 12, 1984, Chicago, Illinois, United States. Holding formal degrees in chemistry and pharmacology, Doctor Richard Tygan was once a respected member of the scientific community. Before the invasion, Dr. Tygan worked in the pharmaceutical industry primarily studying immunosuppressant drugs for use with organ transplants procedures. With the collapse of the global economy following the war, Tygan was left with little alternative in terms of utilizing his skillset outside of ADVENT's widespread calls for cooperation among the scientific community. Employed in one of the earliest gene therapy clinics, Tygan found himself thrust into a project dealing with cranial implants.\n\nAfter growing disenfranchised by some of the processes he witnessed while serving under ADVENT, Tygan sought contacts within the Resistance in the hopes of atoning for his contributions to ADVENT's work. Dr. Tygan is now the central figure in XCOM's scientific pursuits, a crucial contributor in the fight against alien dominion over Earth. -> 1984年5月12日出生于美国伊利诺州芝加哥。理查德·泰根博士拥有化学和药物学的正式学位，曾经是科学界备受尊敬的一员。外星人入侵之前，泰根博士在制药产业工作，主要研究免疫抑制类药物在器官移植手术方面的使用。由于开战后全球经济崩溃，变种人要求科学界全面合作，泰根几乎没有选择的余地。在受雇于最早成立的一家基因治疗诊所时，泰根被卷入了一项颅内移植项目。在为变种人效力期间，在亲眼目睹一些手术后，他感觉越来越没有人权，于是开始尝试与反抗军内部人士取得联系，以弥补他为变种人效力带来的罪孽。泰根博士现在是XCOM科研方面的中心人物，是反抗外星人统治地球之战中的关键角色。
Born November 17, 1979, Manhattan, Kansas, United States. Limited service record U.S. Military Intelligence 1999. First assigned to operational directive XCOM Project February 14, 2015. Primarily serving an organizational role, providing tactical and strategic support to XCOM's commanding officer, Central Officer Bradford was chosen for his loyalty and commitment to the task at hand. Unfortunately, a gross underestimation of the aliens' numbers and technological advancement left Bradford and XCOM with limited capability to fend off the invasion.\n\nWithin a matter of weeks, XCOM's underground headquarters was infiltrated and destroyed, leaving the organization in shambles. Bradford was apparently left to fend for himself, surviving in the shadows, nurturing a growing affection for distilled spirits. In the time since, he did manage to secure connections within the Resistance, providing the foundation for renewed XCOM operations across the globe.\n\nC.O. BRADFORD [SYSTEM DICTATION]: I'm not sure who's compiling the personnel reports these days, judging by the language I'm guessing Tygan, but let's get a few things straight. There was no \"gross underestimation\" of the aliens, we knew exactly what was coming, and we pulled together the best men and women the world had to offer. It wasn't enough. They used our own people against us, some kind of Psionic control, took down our security grid from the inside. I did everything I could. I know Shen got out, but I lost track of Vahlen... Not too worried about her though. Either way, we've got the present to worry about now, not the past. -> 1979年11月17日出生于美国堪萨斯州曼哈顿。1999年曾在美国军事情报局服役。2015年2月14日首次被任命为XCOM计划的行动主管。指挥中心长官布拉福德主要担任组织者角色，为XCOM指挥官提供战术和策略支援。他被选中是因为他的忠诚以及强烈的使命感。不幸的是，由于对外星人数量和技术先进性的严重低估，使布拉福德和XCOM击退外星人入侵的能力受限。在几周时间里，XCOM的地下总部就遭到渗透和摧毁，整个组织举步维艰。显然布拉福德只能自力更生，躲藏在暗处，卧薪尝胆。不过在接下来的时间里，他成功与反抗军内部取得了联系，为在全球各地重新开展XCOM行动打下了基础。\n\n军事中心长官布拉福德[口述记录]：我不知道最近谁在负责整理人员报告，根据措辞风格来看应该是泰根，不过有些事情我要说清楚。我们根本没有\"严重低估\"外星人，其实早就预料到了外星人的入侵，还召集了全世界最优秀的人员来进行抵抗，但这并不足够。外星人采用了某种灵能控制手段，利用我们的人来对付我们，从内部摧毁了我们的安全防御系统。我尽了最大努力。我知道沈逃出去了，但与瓦伦失去了联系...不过不必太过担心她。不管如何，现在我们必须专心应付眼前的局面，而不是纠结于过去。
Born and raised in <XGParam:StrValue0/!CountryName/>, <XGParam:StrValue1/!FirstName/> is something of a wild card, with no formal training to speak of. He may be just the kind of recruit XCOM needs. -> 出生在<XGParam:StrValue0/!CountryName/>的<XGParam:StrValue1/!FirstName/>俨然是个异类，他虽未受过任何正式的训练，但却有常人没有的才能。他说不定正是XCOM缺少的那种人才。

Brief eyewitness accounts, including one from our own Central Officer Bradford indicate that the aliens once fielded a similar biomechatronic organism during the earliest days of the invasion. Those reports however, describe a much more gruesome and rudimentary creature versus the subject we encounter in the present day. The modern specimen could almost be described as elegant in appearance; an authoritative, intimidating figure with the advanced weaponry to match. R. Tygan. -> 一些目击者，包括军事中心长官布拉德福德的证词中都说道外星人曾经在入侵最开始的几日，部署过一种类似的生化机械电子的有机体。这些报告描述了一种比起我们现在遇到的更为可怖以及原始的生物。现在这种物种的外观已经完全可以用优雅来形容，同样也是一种持有先进武器的恐怖形象。理查德·泰根。

By closely examining the aliens' own means of harnessing and wielding Psionic energy, I believe the chances are good that we'll have more than enough viable candidates to serve as Psi Operatives. However, with the advanced Psionic capabilities we've seen from the various alien species in the field, it may not be enough. In preparation for this new class of soldiers, I've used the chip removed from the Commander to study the technology needed to focus and divert Psionic energy. As a result, I've developed a Psionic amplifier capable of focusing and enhancing the Psionic energy they will be trained to harness. Although the potential for negative side effects will be high, I foresee the possibility that our soldiers will be able to push their new powers beyond the limits of what we might consider safe. R. Tygan. -> 只要仔细研究外星人利用灵能的方法，我相信我们有还是可以找出很多有灵能潜力的候选人的。不过这可能还是远远不够，因为我们在战场上也看到了各种各样的外星物种有着更高级的灵能力量。在准备训练这些士兵之前，我研究了一下从指挥官脑袋里拿出来的芯片来看看什么技术可以集中并且转移灵能力量。研究好后我发明了这个灵能扩大器，它可以集中并且能提升士兵的灵能力量。虽然很有可能会有副作用，但我相信我们的士兵可以突破极限。理查德·泰根

By serving together on combat missions, XCOM soldiers gain familiarity with one another and form a cohesive team. If they've worked well together, it will eventually be possible to have these soldiers form a \"Soldier Bond,\" which can be improved by training together in the Training Center. As their bond continues to grow, these soldiers will receive a range of bonus capabilities including improved aim, additional shots, and opportunities to retaliate against enemies who strike their teammate. -> XCOM在共同执行战斗任务后会逐渐互相熟悉，形成一支富有凝聚力的队伍。如果他们之间相性很好，还有可能让这些士兵在训练中心里共同训练，缔结\"士兵羁绊。\"一旦他们结成羁绊，两名士兵共同出战时的士气就会显著提升。随着他们羁绊的成长，这些士兵还会获得包括命中率提升、额外射击机会和报复攻击队友的敌人的机会之类的增益。

First we hack the heart of the ADVENT tower and disrupt their network before the speaker finishes his latest broadcast. Shen's cooking up a little surprise for them that should more than get their attention. With ADVENT in an uproar we'll access the portal and take the fight to their front door. All goes well, they won't even see us coming. It's risky, but it's the best shot we'll get. Once we start this, there's no turning back. -> 指挥官，是时候和变种人算一算总账了。我们意图要双管齐下。首先我们侵入变种人网络塔的中心，在发言人完成最后的广播前干扰他们的网络。沈在为他们准备一些小惊喜来吸引变种人的注意力。当变种人部队骚动时，我们就会进入入口并一路向他们的前门进发。如果一切顺利，他们不会发现我们来了。这次行动风险很大，但是我们最好的机会了。一旦开始，我们就无法回头了。

Commander, as the resistance continues to grow, we'll have a better chance of finding openings to strike back at ADVENT. As it is, we've already identified a potential target to disrupt the aliens' operations in this region. Our window of opportunity is limited, so we'll have to move fast. -> 指挥官，随着反抗军持续地扩张，我们将有更好的机会回击变种人。事实上，我们已经在该区域确定了一个潜在的目标，可以干扰外星人的行动。机会转瞬即逝，我们需要尽快行动。

Commander, based on my research in collaboration with Shen, I believe we can reduce the Intel costs of contacting additional regions by building radio relay towers along our network. The further a region is from a relay, the more it will cost us in Intel, so I would suggest building relays along the remote edges of our existing network. I believe the resistance will be grateful for the construction of these relays, they may reward us in kind. -> 指挥官，根据我和沈的研究，我相信通过使用我们的网络建立无线电中继塔来联系其他地区可以减少情报消耗。地区离我们的中继站越远，情报消耗就越大，所以我建议在我们现存网络的边缘建立中继站。我相信反抗军会感激这些中继站的，他们或许会因此嘉奖我们。

Commander, our current position is here, just outside resistance headquarters. When we're not on the move this will serve as our home and source of supplies. The councilman has traced the alien blacksite to this region. Unfortunately, we don't have its exact coordinates yet. If we're going to have any chance of finding this facility we'll need to make contact with the local resistance cell nearby. Tygan has a theory about how we might reach out to them without getting the aliens' attention but, we'll need to give him time to conduct his research. We shouldn't wait too long on that Commander. We have to start making contact with other regions soon if we're going to build a global resistance and take on ADVENT. -> 指挥官，我军当前驻扎在反抗军总部外，如果我们不进行任何行动，这里就会被默认为我军营地和补给源。议员已经确定本地区含有外星人黑地，但我们尚无法获得确切坐标，我们可以与附近的反抗军联络一下，这样就可以在他们的协助下确定黑地位置。泰根博士相信自己可以研究出如何在不惊动外星人的情况下与各地反抗军取得联系，但可能要花些时间。我不建议等太久，指挥官，我们应该尽快联络各地反抗军，建立全球反抗军统一战线，一举打垮变种人。

We should build the facility as soon as possible. -> 指挥官，我们的士兵在继续在并肩作战的过程中结成羁绊。然而，没有训练中心的额外训练，他们的羁绊就无法成长。我们应该尽快建造一个训练中心。

As cocky as those things are, we can expect the favored one to be tougher in combat and even more disruptive of our strategic operations. Like they weren't bad enough before. -> 指挥官，我们的情报源显示长老们决定将天选者的其中一人认作宠儿。虽然听上去很滑稽，但那个被偏爱的天选者在战斗中很有可能会变得更为强大，对我们行动的干扰也会更加频繁。真是越来越棘手了。

Commander, over time the stress of combat starts to wear on even our toughest soldiers. We can push them further if we need to, but it's best to let them recover for a few days before sending them back into battle. -> 指挥官，即使是最为强韧的士兵，也会被战斗的压力拖垮。必要的时候我们得让他们执行任务，但条件允许的话还是让他们在重新投入战斗前休息几天为好。
Commander, please thank our troops for completing what was surely a difficult task in acquiring the Codex Brain. We'll begin work on it as soon as possible. -> 指挥官，多亏我们军队完成了获取原典脑的艰难任务。我们会尽快开始解码的。
Commander, remember no matter how tough things get down here, we can't EVAC until we complete the mission. -> 指挥官，请牢记，无论情况有多艰险，在任务结束前我们都无法撤离。

Commander, so far these Skirmishers have been true to their word. Their operative has just relayed the coordinates for their acting headquarters, here, which considering their history, is a big step for them. It'd be worth spending some time here to investigate the area. And meet their leader, Betos. -> 指挥官，目前来看这些散兵说的话都是真的。他们的联络员刚刚发给我们他们目前总部的坐标，你看，考虑到他们的过去，这已经是很大的进步了。去那里调查一番应该会有所收获，还能见见他们的领袖，贝托斯。
Commander, so far we've managed to triage the wounded, but they'd be much better served if we had an infirmary available. -> 指挥官，目前我们已经把伤员分类，但如果有医务室的话他们会受到更好的治疗。
Commander, some of these soldiers are exhausted and will be very unstable in the field. It's best to let them sit this one out if we have rested troops to take their place. -> 指挥官，我们有一些士兵已经精神透支了，在战场的情绪会更加不稳定。如果有额外的人手，还是让这些士兵休整一下为好。

Commander, that was Konstantine Volikov, "Volk" to his friends. He and his Reapers are a big part of the reason why you're standing here today. -> 指挥官，这位是康斯坦丁·沃里科夫，他的朋友们称他为\"沃尔克\"。他和他的死神是你的救援行动的主要执行人。
Commander, that's it...we've lost the squad. -> 指挥官，到此为止了...我们失去了这支队伍。
Commander, the Avenger's remote scanning capabilities will help us search the area for clues or other resources. It's going to take some time though, we've got a lot of ground to cover. -> 指挥官，复仇者号的远程扫描能力能帮助我们搜索区域来寻找线索和其他资源。这会花一点时间，因为我们有许多地方需要调查。
Commander, the Chosen are getting closer to hunting us down every day. The only way we can stop them is to strike first, and we'll need to work on a Covert Action with the Resistance in order to do that. We should head to the Ring. -> 指挥官，天选者离我们越来越近了。唯一阻止他们的办法就是抢先出击，所以我们得和反抗军一起策划一次隐秘行动。去议事厅讨论一下吧。

Despite having reviewed both reconnaissance footage and eyewitness accounts from our soldiers in the field, until I had seen this specimen in person, it did not fully register just how unusual it is. Known colloquially as a \"Spectre\" based on its shadowy form, in the field, the subject is most often seen maintaining a roughly humanoid form. However, when moving or engaging in combat actions, this form is quickly broken to reveal the truly amorphous nature of the Spectre.\n\nAlthough I had conceived of a number of theories as to how this was taking place, e.g. swarming nanorobots, alien insects, perhaps even some sort of Psionic particle-matrix, it isn't immediately clear that any of those hypotheses are out of the realm of possibility.  As of yet we've found no means of recovering one of these Spectres in their \"assembled\" form, leaving little evidence as to their true composition. Although it would seem likely that the Spectre holds some intrinsic connection to the equally elusive Codex, their means of traversing our world are distinct enough to require a different approach if we hope to further our research. -R. Tygan -> 尽管我早已从侦查影像和士兵在战场上的目击证言了解过该样本，但亲眼看到它才让我真正意识到它有多么的异常。因其鬼魅一般的形态，我们将它命名为\"幽灵\"，该对象在战场上最常出现的形态是粗糙的人形。然而，当它移动或采取进攻时，这一形态就会完全消失，揭露其无定形的本质。\n\n虽然我对其形态的真相做过许多推论，例如集群的纳米机器人、外星昆虫，甚至是某种灵能粒子矩阵，但很快就发现这些推论都完全站不住脚。 目前为止我们都没能回收到\"聚合\"形态的幽灵，也就无从得知它们是如何合体的了。不过它们似乎和同样捉摸不定的原典有一定的联系，因此它们在我们世界中穿行的本领有进一步研究的价值，但首先我们需要调整研究的方向。-理查德·泰根

Early reports from the Resistance referencing an alien creature said to be capable of \"shapeshifting\" were initially dismissed by local cell leaders who attributed the sightings to combat stress and malnutrition. It wasn't until our own forces engaged with the creature that we successfully confirmed its existence. Surprisingly enough, the description of the creature from those early reports was quite accurate.\n\nWith a varying height of up to three meters, the specimen currently referred to as the "Faceless" has one of the most unusual internal structures I've ever encountered. Where one might expect to find a skeletal foundation, we instead see a series of malleable chitin-like structures providing various points for the expansion of several equally unusual fluid membranes.\n\nThe membranes in question are responsible for the Faceless' extraordinary ability to mirror the form of a human. In recirculating key cellular combinations via an elaborate internal structure, the Faceless is capable of forming solid shapes while also mirroring colors and textures without physical sampling. As of yet we've only seen evidence of the Faceless attempting to imitate humans, but not other species or inanimate objects. Whether or not this is a limitation of their genetic makeup, or an intentional manipulation of their abilities by the aliens, we cannot say at this time. R. Tygan. -> 反抗军组织早期的报告提到了一种外星物种能够\"变形\"，最初这些报告被当地的领导者将其归结于战斗压力和营养不良产生的错觉。直到我们自己的部队遇到了这种生物，我们才确认了它的存在。令人惊讶的是，早期对这些物种的报告颇为精准。\n\n大约有不超过3米的身高，这些被称为无面怪的物种在我见过的所有生物中，有着最不同寻常的内部结构。一般生物内部都能找到骨骼架构，而这个生物体内我们只发现了一系列可塑性的甲壳质结构，这种结构提供了一些同样不同寻常的流动细胞膜扩张的可能。\n\n而这些细胞膜就是无面怪能够变形为其他人类形态的关键所在。在通过一个复杂的内部结构中关键细胞组合的循环，无面怪能够形成固体的形态，同时也能在没有物理样本的情况下复制颜色和质地。目前，我们只见过它们变身人类的证据，但没有变为其它物种或是静物的迹象。这或许因为它们基因组成的限制，又或许是外星人所故意隐藏能力，我们目前还没有定论。理查德·泰根。

Even though we're learning more about the alien's varying uses for the Psionic energy fields they manipulate, so far we haven't spent much time trying to harness these capabilities for our own purposes. Direct access to the biomechanical alien we've been calling the \"Codex\" has given us far better insight into the nature of Psionics than any of our previous experimentation. The Codex has the unique ability to phase through not just physical objects, but between worlds, and, in theory, dimensions. By focusing a carefully balanced pulse of Psionic energy, the Codex creates a rift, effectively peeling back the layers of spacetime. The possible implications of this ability are mind bobbling, but it's safe to say I won't be recommending we pursue this advance to the Commander. However, there are other areas of interest tied Codex. During our testing, we conceived of the possibility that the Psionic pulse could be diverted, or scattered, across an electromagnetic field integrated into a suit of armor. This would effectively create a weakened rift throughout the suit, allowing the wearer to phase through objects within our own dimension. The prototype is stable, but field trials are ongoing. L. Shen. -> 虽然我们仍在继续学习外星人对灵能力场的不同应用，但目前我们很少花时间试图将这些能力化为己用。直接进入这些被我们称为\"原典\"的生化机械的外星人给了我们比之前所有实验都要明晰的关于灵能本质的信息。原典拥有的独特能力，能让它不仅在物理世界内穿梭，更能够跨次元的穿梭。通过聚集起极为小心平衡的灵能脉冲，原典制造出一道时空裂痕，能够有效地穿梭空间与时间。这种能力的应用可能会花费我毕生的精力，简单来说，我不会把这种方法推荐给我们的指挥官。然而，关于原典还有其他有趣的地方。在我们测试中，我们证明了灵能脉冲一可以被扭转，或分散，并通过磁能场集成入护甲之中，让穿戴者能够穿过我们这个维度内的物体。原型体非常稳定，但实地测试还在进行中。莉莉·沈

Every soldier deployed in the field will now display their "Will" stat in addition to the standard health and combat indicators. Actions on the battlefield that negatively affect a soldier, for instance being wounded or seeing an ally killed, will lower a soldier's Will. Allowing a soldier to rest on the Avenger will slowly recover their will. However, if a soldier is pushed to their limits and their Will drops significantly, they will eventually become Tired or Shaken and are vulnerable to gaining negative traits. Negative traits can either be Phobias, where our soldier develops a fear of some specific enemy or action, or Behaviors, where our soldier acts out in ways beyond our control. -> 现在每名部署在战场上的士兵的状态栏内除了标准的生命值和战斗标识外还会出现\"意志力\"这一状态。战场上会对士兵造成负面影响的行为，如受伤或是看见友军被杀，都会降低士兵的意志力。让士兵在复仇者号上休息能逐渐恢复其意志力。然而，如果让士兵过度操劳，他们的意志力就会显著下降，最后会变得疲惫或是动摇，还有患上负面特质的几率。负面特质有可能是让士兵对某种特定的敌人或是行为产生恐惧的恐惧症，也有可能是让士兵擅自行动的不听命令现象。

For a second there, Tygan had my hopes up, with all his talk of the Elders dying I thought we might have caught a break. I should have known it wasn't gonna be that simple.

If we stop the cure, we stop the Elders. -> 有那么一瞬间，泰根让我燃起了希望，他说长老们已经快死了，我以为我们可以至少休息一阵了。我早该知道这一切不会这么简单。而且当然长老们的对策总是围绕着在人类身上展开实验，或者是破坏星球，或者就是二者合二为一。我所知道的是，这会是我们终结他们的最好机会。如果我们阻止了他们的治疗，我们就阻止了长老们。

For the aliens, fielding heavier weapons, or more of them, usuallly means using a larger, heavier alien species to haul the gear into battle. For our needs, we have to rely on something more practical. I've has been working on a variety of power-assisted armor prototypes, which, at the very least, should provide a means for our troops to bring another weapon into the fight. By combining these prototypes with the alien alloy plating we've experimented with previously, the armor should also be incredibly durable, more so than anything we've provided to our troops previously. L. Shen. -> 对外星人来说，武器越大，或者数量越多，意味着需要体型更庞大的外星人物种来搬运到战场上使用。我们则要依靠更实用的工具。我一直在研究多种动力辅助型护甲原型，这种护甲至少可以让我们的士兵投入战斗时携带多一件武器。用外星合金镀层配合我们先前研究的样品，护甲的耐久性将非常好，比之前研发的任何东西都好。莉莉·沈。

From Engineering, selecting \"Building Facilities\" will present an array representing the space available for expansion and improvement on board the Avenger. Rooms filled with Alien Debris will require excavation before a new facility can be built. Assign engineers to clear debris-filled rooms or to construct facilities in cleared areas. Differing facilities will have varying construction and upkeep costs, as well as estimated construction times. When staffed, the workshop facility provides a unique adjacency bonus providing Gremlins that can be used to staff any adjoining facilities. -> 在工程部界面选择\"建造设施\"后，即可看到复仇者号上所有可供扩展和提升的空间。充满外星残骸的区域在投入建设前要首先清理干净。派遣工程人员即可进行清理或在清理过的场地上建造，不同设施耗时耗材和维护费用各不相同。当分配了员工之后，工作间设施将会为邻接的设施提供独特加成：提供能够在邻接设施分配的小精灵。
From here we can call upon an endless legion of reinforcements. You will be overrun. Yet our armies could be withdrawn at any time, Commander. Peace is within your grasp, if you would just rejoin us.  -> 在这里我们可以号召无限多的援军部队。你将会被他们所淹没。但是我们的军队可以在任何时候撤退，指挥官。如果你肯重新加入我们的话，和平对你来说只是举手之劳。
From my own experience, ADVENT generally deploys heavy security rather than subterfuge when it comes to protecting their primary facilities, at least the ones I had access to personally. If they have gone to the trouble of hiding this blacksite, I suspect our findings there will lead us to even greater questions. -> 就我个人经验而言，变种人在保护他们的重要设施时，更多的是部署重兵把守而不是耍诡计，至少我以前可以进去的那个就是这样。如果他们在隐藏黑地上出问题，我怀疑我们的发现会将我们引向更大的麻烦。
From our initial breakdown, I have to assume the ADVENT MEC design was at least in-part based on the alien Sectopod, a similar autonomous war machine lacking in biological components. As far as I can tell, the ADVENT variant was supposed to be less intimidating, more suited for urban pacification, or \"peacekeeping\" operations conducted in proximity to the civilian crowds. That facade only works because of the carefully disguised weapons systems integrated throughout the machine. I don't think people would react so calmly if they knew about the micro-missile launching system linked to ADVENT's network, running facial recognition on the crowds at microsecond intervals. L. Shen. -> 从最初的研究看来，我必须承认变种人MEC的设计至少有一部分是基于外星人破坏者的，这是一种类似无生物组件的自动战争机器。我能说的就是，变种人的变体不会那么吓人。他们更适合城市的防暴以及\"维和\"行动以接近市民。而这点能奏效是因为其仔细伪装的武器系统。我觉得人们要是知道其配有的微型导弹系统及包含着连接到变种人网络的瞄准传感器，并以微秒为单位对人群进行人脸识别扫描的话，他们就不会这么冷静了。莉莉·沈。

From the field reports I have managed to assemble, the first sightings of the \"Lost\" likely occurred more than a decade ago, as members of an independent resistance cell in North America encountered what they referred to at the time as \"infected\" civilians. With little in the way of options, the cell leader, a man named Tony Cross, ordered these infected to be destroyed on sight. Knowing what we do now, I can say with confidence that Cross' order may very well have curbed the initial spread of the Lost and saved us from yet another insurmountable threat.\n\n Conducting an autopsy on a subject culled from one of the Lost swarms has proven to be among the more troubling and emotionally-draining procedures I have faced in my time serving XCOM. It was clear from our initial discovery of these creatures in the field that they were once human, with most among them having been civilians. With that knowledge in mind, it fell to me to discover the cause of this extreme, grotesque corruption of these unsuspecting victims.\n\nBased on their proximity to the abandoned cities of the invasion and the information gathered from various eyewitness accounts, our most plausible theory as to the origins of the Lost revolves around the so-called \"Fog Pods\" dropped throughout these cities during the earliest days after the aliens' arrival on Earth. The gas released from these pods was never fully studied, as the invasion took a turn for the worse and Earth's governments were focused entirely on defensive efforts. Unfortunately, with no sample of that particular toxin available today, our focus remained on the subject presented here.\n\nMuch like the Psionic \"zombies\" we have encountered previously, the Lost defy most known medical science that existed before the arrival of the aliens. Despite a catastrophic level of tissue decay, the Lost remain vigorous and agile in the field, attacking on what can only be blind impulse. Their senses are also inexplicably heightened, as they are quickly drawn to the sounds of activity. To the delight of our troops, the traditional lore of Earth still applies today, as any damage to the cranial tissue of the Lost...a headshot, has proven to be the absolute means of termination.  As to what it is that changed these unfortunate souls into what they are today, or better still what it is that drives their otherwise lifeless forms, we may never know. -R. Tygan. -> 从我能够收集到的战场报告来看，首次目击\"失魂者\"的记录可以追溯到十年以前，一个在北美的独立反抗组织成员遇到了它，并在那时将其称为\"被感染的\"市民。目击到的小队领袖，名为托尼·克洛斯的男人并没有多少选择，命令下属在见到这些感染者时就立刻消灭。从现在已知情况来看，我可以相当自信地说克洛斯的命令非常好地抑制了失魂者最初的蔓延，并且将我们从另一个难以对付的威胁中拯救出来。\n\n对这个从失魂者潮中回收到的样本的研究可以说是在我与XCOM共事后所遭遇的最费时费力的工作，同时也是最让我悲痛欲绝的。我们初次在战场上发现这些生物时就明白他们曾经是人类，其中大部分还是平民。身为XCOM的首席研究员，我有义务查清这些无辜的受害者是经历了多么可怕的过程才腐化为此等怪物的。\n\n 根据他们在入侵时与这些废弃城市间的距离和多名目击证人提供的信息，我所能做出的可能性的理论是这些失魂者是受外星人早期入侵地球时投放的所谓的\"迷雾舱\"影响而转化的。我们从未有机会仔细研究那些舱体中释放的气体，而且当时外星人势头正盛，地球政府疲于防守，无暇他顾。所以遗憾的是目前我们已经无法获得该毒素的样本，只能专注于研究当前的对象了。\n\n 跟我们之前遭遇过的灵能\"僵尸\"相似的是，失魂者完全背离了我们在外星人降临前的医学常识。尽管它们的组织衰减到了无可救药的程度，但它们在战场上的行动却相当敏捷，出于本能袭击着任何生物。 它们的感官也是相当敏锐，对声音尤其敏感。幸运的是，地球上流传许久的对僵尸用特效手段，也就是对失魂者的头盖骨的打击...俗称爆头，能够有效地终结它们的生理活动。至于这些不幸的灵魂是如何堕落至此，以及他们现在行动的目标，我们或许永远都没法知道了。-理查德·泰根

From what I've been told, our troops took to calling this large robotic unit a Sectopod under the initial assumption that it was being controlled by a Sectoid pilot. On closer inspection, we can see that is not the case. Not unlike the mechanized ADVENT units, which were likely derived from the Sectopod itself, this machine seems to be entirely autonomous. -> 就我听到的而言，我们的部队管这个大型机器人单位叫破坏者是因为他们一开始以为它是由灰人机师控制的。仔细检查后，我们发现实际上不是。机械化变种单位似乎是由破坏者直接演变而来的，这个机器也一样是完全自动的。
From what I've heard, the resistance has already seen a boost in their recruitment efforts after word of the Commander's arrival got around. They've needed a leader just as much as we have, and now they'll be expecting us to hit the aliens where it hurts. Not that I'm worried, we've got plenty of people itching to take on ADVENT. Things are just getting interesting. -> 以我所见，自从指挥官到来的消息传开之后，反抗军的征兵变得容易了许多。他们也和我们一样需要一个领导者，现在他们希望我们找外星人算账。并不是说我有些担心，只是说我们现在已经有了很多希望给变种人一点颜色看看的人了，事情开始变得有趣了。
From what I've heard, you Reapers have a taste for alien meat. I'm something of a hunter myself, so I won't hold it against you. -> 据我所知，死神喜欢吃外星人的肉。我自己也是个猎人，所以对此并没有什么意见。
From what I've seen, you could use the practice. -> 从目前来看，你大可用你的经验来做。
From what we can gather, someone tried to hijack an ADVENT transport near here. The aliens pursued, and now their cargo is scattered throughout this region. We know they're out there looking for this stuff, but it's worth the risk to investigate. We'll need to secure the site, eliminate any hostile resistance, and recover the item. -> 据我们所知，反抗军在附近瘫痪了一辆变种人运输工具，留下了一些可收集的装备。我们预计外星人也准备去回收车辆，但值得冒险去调查一下。我们需要肃清那里，消灭任何敌人，并收集物品。
From what we know of them, the Templars have relied on their Psionic powers to keep themselves hidden from ADVENT's prying eyes. They won't be easy to find, but if we send in a small team to explain what we're trying to do, maybe they'll see the light. -> 据我们所知，圣殿骑士是通过自身的灵能力量来躲避变种人追杀的。要找到他们并不容易，但如果我们派一支小队前去解释我们的意图，或许他们会愿意与我们合作。
From what we've seen of the aliens' activities and their lack of regard for human life, preserving those of us that are still around has to become a task of equal importance to eliminating the alien threat itself. The success of this entire undertaking hinges on our ability to keep our soldiers healthy and ready for battle at a moment's notice. In working towards that aim, our latest armor prototype utilizes more of the alien alloys than any we've previously assembled, and as expected the durability and potential for damage mitigation is extremely impressive. Initial trials show the armor to be capable of withstanding a direct hit from focused plasma at 5m, enough so to increase survivability by a substantial margin. I plan on advising the senior staff not to inform the troops of any perceived toughness associated with the suit, I would hate for our forces to grow reliant on it despite our best intentions. L. Shen. -> 从我们已经目睹的外星人活动以及他们对人生命的践踏来说，想要继续维持人类的生存已经变得和消灭外星人的威胁一样重要了。这一整个事件的成功依赖于我们保持士兵健康的能力，以及随时准备战斗的能力。为了完成这一目标，我们最新的护甲原型比它之前任何一部都使用了更多的外星合金，与预期一样，耐久度和伤害减免的可能性都给人留下了深刻的印象。最初的试验显示该护甲能够承受来自5米之外瞄准电浆的正面攻击，足以增加士兵的生存能力从而带来大量的利润。我建议高级工程师们不要告知士兵们任何有关这件套装强度的事情，我不希望我们的部队过度依赖这样的护甲。莉莉·沈。

Full Name: Unknown. Birthdate: Unknown. Affiliation: Resistance. The reclusive, unidentified agent known only as the \"Spokesman\" was once the public representative of the Council responsible for organizing the XCOM initiative. Following the collapse of Earth's established governments, all indications are that the Spokesman served under ADVENT to an unknown extent. Through his own admission, he apparently used his position to provide information and material support to the fledgling Resistance movement. It was during this time that contact between the Spokesman and C.O. Bradford was first reestablished, leading to the eventual rescue of the Commander and the current operational status of the renewed XCOM-coordinated Resistance movement. -> 全名：不明。出生日期：不明。所属：反抗军。隐居的不明身份特工，只知道他的绰号为\"线人\"，曾经是负责成立XCOM计划的理事会公开代表。地球原有各大政权崩溃之后，一切迹象表明，线人不知出于何种目的而为变种人效力。他本人表示，他在利用自己的职位，为缺乏经验的反抗军运动提供情报和物质支持。就在这段时间里，线人与指挥中心长官布拉福德首次建立起联系，从而最终营救出指挥官，并带来了当前全新的XCOM与反抗军协作行动的作战局面。

Having already suspected that the material being produced at the first ADVENT Blacksite was tied directly to the aliens' operations at the Forge facility, it isn't entirely surprising to me that we've now discovered the apparent \"product\" of these efforts.\n\nPresented in some form of stasis or containment suit similar in appearance to that in which we found the Commander, the subject is vaguely humanoid in form. The physical similarities aren't as readily apparent beyond first impressions, as the specimen appears to be in an \"incomplete\" state, which I initially theorized could be the result of an elaborate cloning operation. Unfortunately, having completed an extensive analysis of the subject's DNA and genetic structure, I believe clones would have been the lesser concern.\n\nWhat we have actually recovered is a \"foundation,\" the structure upon which a new lifeform could be built, assuming we hadn't disrupted the process. Knowing what we do about the aliens' activities at the Blacksite, it is my unfortunate conclusion that the human captives, be they prisoners or abductees, were processed and consumed as part of the development of this specimen.\n\nNotably, the human genetic material involved in this process comes from the more Psionically sensitive members of the human population, no doubt an intentional culling carefully executed by ADVENT's forces. Regardless, one question remains - what is the missing component? What is intended to fill the genetic void that would have brought this creature to life? R. Tygan. -> 我早就怀疑在第一个变种人黑地产出的材料和外星人在锻造厂的行动有关，所以当我们最终获得这些\"产品\"时我一点也不惊讶。\n\n这个物品保存于某种静滞或是隔离服内，就和我们找到指挥官的时候一样，是人形形状。不过外表上的相似处再看之后就没有第一眼看上去那么明显了，因为这个物种显然是\"未完成\"状态，我最初猜想这可能是一个克隆计划的产物。不幸的是，在完成了整体的DNA检测后，我相信克隆在它面前也是小巫见大巫了。\n\n我们其实是发现了一个\"基体\"，是一个可以让新生命使用的基础结构，如果我们没有干扰它的开发过程，它一定会成为一个新生命。了解了外星人在黑地的活动后，我得出一个不幸的结论：人类俘虏完全就是这个物种开发过程中的试验品和消耗品。\n\n尤其，这里使用的人类基因材料都来自对灵能比较敏感的人群，这肯定都是故意的。不管怎样，现在就剩下一个问题了，缺失的部分到底是什么？这种生物的基因到底还要什么部分才能活过来？理查德·泰根。
Having completed our analysis of the substance tentatively referred to as \"Elerium 115,\" it's clear that this material is unlike any other naturally occurring element on Earth. Presumably the aliens extracted their undoubtedly extensive stores of Elerium from another planet, but that is beyond my capacity to surmise. What I do know with certainty is that this element is incredibly reactive when exposed to high energy particle fields, providing a source of nearly limitless power that defies all known efficiency standards. Unfortunately, I see no means of replicating or synthesizing this substance with the resources available to us on Earth. The materials we recover from the aliens themselves will likely constitute the entirety of our available stockpile. The Commander will have to be careful in choosing how to allocate these precious resources. R. Tygan. -> 我们完成了对暂时被称为超铀115物质的分析，结果显示该材料不属于任何自然出现在地球上的元素。大概外星人从其他毋庸置疑储藏着大量超铀的星球上带了一些到地球上来，但对那进行推测已经超出了我的能力范围。我确定知道的事情是这个物质在高能粒子力场中反应非常剧烈，产生了一个近乎无限的藐视一切现有效率标准的能量源。遗憾的是，我用地球上能利用的一切资源还找不到复制或合成这一物质的方法。我们从外星人那收回的材料很可能能够构成我们全部可用的库存。指挥官将要谨慎选择如何去分配这些宝贵的资源。理查德·泰根。
Having destroyed their blacksite, you've dealt a blow to the alien operations, Commander, but there is still no time to lose.  -> 摧毁了黑地是场重大胜利，也重创了外星人的行动，指挥官。但我们没有什么时间了。
Having developed a greater understanding of the aliens' encryption methods, we can now construct a facility designed specifically to analyze any materials we recover related to their Avatar project. I would suggest we begin immediately, Commander. -> 指挥官，通过研究外星人加密技术，我们已可建立专业设施，专门分析我军回收的有关化身计划的各种材料。我建议马上动工。
Having encountered a number of aliens capable of wielding Psionic power, it should come as no surprise that their aptitude and abilities are often unique to a given species. In this case the subject henceforth referred to as the "Gatekeeper," is on the extreme end of the spectrum in terms of Psionic sensitivity.\n\nHowever, our efforts to analyze the subject have so far revealed little in terms of its actual purpose or intention in the field. Unlike the Codex, so far we've found nothing that would allow the Gatekeeper to open or control a rift. All current indications point to an unusually independent, unpredictable species. R. Tygan. -> 在遭遇了许多能够运用灵能能量的外星人后，我们发现每个物种都有独特的灵能天资和能力。\"看门人\"是因为最初在灵能门附近遇到而命名的，它的灵能敏感性就是一个极端的案例。\n\n然而，我们对它真正目的的研究几乎没有进展。与原典不同，目前我们发现看门人根本无法打开或是控制裂缝。所有目前的研究都指出它不同寻常、独立自主、深不可测。理查德·泰根。
Having failed to destroy the alien's facility, they will continue to advance  their efforts in developing the Avatar Project. Should another opportunity arise, you will have to do better, Commander. -> 摧毁外星人的设施失败，他们将继续在化身计划上取得进展。我们需要另寻方案，你还得更努力，指挥官。
Having fallen to one of the lesser Chosen, defeat has already clouded your vision. It won't be long now.  -> 被更弱小的天选者击败，看来你的失败是命中注定的，准备接受自己的命运吧。
Having finally gotten a closer look at the Gauss rifle technology ADVENT has deployed among their forces, I'm fairly confident we can develop a magnetic weapon system of comparable power. The obvious question, why not simply use the ADVENT weapons directly, was discovered early on by Resistance forces in the field. Some years ago, the aliens began integrating a sort of genetic-verification technology into their weapons that prevents them from functioning by any species whose DNA has not been pre-encoded. Unfortunately, the system also exerts lethal force on an unsuspecting unauthorized user - a fact we should disseminate as widely as possible among the Resistance cells we have contact with. As for our own variation on the technology, Dr. Shen and I have taken components of the alien weaponry recovered from the field and utilized the key elements to develop a sustainable prototype. We can safely begin reproducing the system as the needed materials become available. R. Tygan. -> 仔细观察变种人军队使用的高斯步枪技术后，我认为我们也可以研发出一款实力相当的磁力武器了。有人问，为什么不直接使用反抗军拿回来的变种人武器呢？ 因为早在多年前，外星人就把基因验证融合到他们的武器里来防御DNA未编码的种族使用这些武器。而且，这个系统还会杀死非授权用户。我们应该尽量把这个消息告诉所有反抗军。至于技术上变化应用，沈博士和我已经从战场的上外星武器中提取了一些关键部件做成了一个稳定的原型。只要有必要材料，我们就可以开始安全生产这种系统了。理查德·泰根。
Having found various means of integrating the alien materials within designs better suited to our own troops, I think it may be possible to assemble armor made entirely of the recovered alloys and powered by an Elerium cell. It should be incredibly strong, and able to withstand even direct hits from most alien weaponry. -> 已经找出多种方法把外星人材料和更符合我们士兵的设计融为一体，我相信现在也许可以制造出完全用再生合金做的护甲。这种护甲非常坚固，可以承受大部分外星人武器的正面攻击。
Having never seen any of the previous Muton variants personally, I can only go by the stories I've heard from Central Officer Bradford and others. As they say, the current breed is apparently on the smaller side, although considerably more agile than the originals. Internally, the subject maintains all the hallmarks of extensive genetic modification, with additional musculature and bone protecting the internal organs from any risk of direct contact. The aliens clearly spent a great deal of time and effort honing the abilities of the Muton as a front-line combat soldier. I had heard that our soldiers believe the Mutons to be part of a tribal society, at least originally, based on their unusual battle cries and markings seen in the field. Having finally gotten a closer look, I can confirm the presence of unusual scarification that could certainly be attributed to ritualistic behavior of some kind. R. Tygan. -> 我没有亲眼见过任何以前的异变者变种，只听过军事中心长官布拉德福德和其它人说的故事。他们说，目前的品种明显属于更小的一类，但是比原品种灵敏多了。该物种在内部留下了大量基因修正的印记，还有额外的肌肉组织和骨骼来保护内部器官。外星人肯定花了大量的时间和精力把异变者打造成可以在前线作战的士兵。我之前听说我们的士兵相信异变者是部落社会的一员，至少最初是，因为他们在战场会使用特殊的战斗口号和标志。近距离查看后，我才确定是某种仪式造成了这种特殊痕迹。理查德·泰根。
Having never stepped foot in one of the city centers, I've never actually had one of the these ADVENT burgers I keep hearing rumors about. No one really seems to be asking the hard questions either, like, when was the last time you even saw a cow? -> 我从没去过变种人的市中心，所以从没见过传说中那些变种人派发的汉堡。没人想过这些问题吗，比如，你还记得你最后一次什么时候看到牛吗？
Having now seen the inner workings of the Blacksite facility, the outcome is perhaps even more troubling than I had expected. It is clear the aliens have undertaken a gruesome task. I will leave this matter for you to investigate, Commander. -> 在见识过黑地设施里的杰作之后，结果比我想象中的可能要更加棘手。不管那是什么，总之外星人正在做一项很恐怖的任务。我觉得还是让你来负责调查吧，指挥官。
Having recently discovered an alien data cache storing valuable enemy intelligence, I can dedicate my team's resources to decrypting the files and ensuring that we recover the large amount of Intel stored within. -> 我们成功截获了一个储存着大量敌情的资料盘，我会让大家全力破解这些文件，确保能够取得这些情报。
Having recovered both of the Chosen Assassin's weapons from the field, a shotgun and a modular sword, I must admit I am intrigued by the advances the aliens have managed to craft into these otherwise conventional weapons.\n\nThe shotgun, used primarily as a secondary weapon by the Elders' Assassin, is elegant in its simplicity and adherence to a singular purpose. Built upon an advanced composite frame, in close quarters the unique design is nearly unmatched by any other projectile weapon. During repeated field trials, the fully enclosed Magnetic Ordnance Reduction System consistently delivered a tightly patterned array of alloy fragments capable of penetrating all but the most unyielding of targets.\n\nThe Assassin's prized sword is something else entirely, and may be among the more unique and perhaps important weapons we have ever recovered. Despite attempts at nondestructive analysis of the sword's composition, including variations on X-ray fluorescence, I have yet to make any significant progress towards identifying the material in question. As it stands, we know only that the sword is forged of a non-terrestrial metallic element held in tight suspension by Psionic energy that is itself contained by forces unknown. By all accounts, this weapon is a prize for both the warrior and the scholar alike. -R. Tygan. -> 从战场上回收到天选者刺客的两把武器后，我得承认，外星人在这两把可说是比较传统的武器上投入的科技水平让我自叹不如。\n\n这把霰弹枪是天选者刺客的备用武器，它的设计精致而简洁，只为一个目的服务。它的高级复合框架使它在近距离内的威力超越了其他所有枪械武器。这种经过多次实战考验的全封闭磁能重火力减震系统能够稳定地发射出排列紧密的合金弹片，即便是最为强韧的目标也经不住它的一击。\n\n刺客的这把宝剑则完全是另外一回事了，并且它可能是我们回收到的最重要的武器。 尽管我已经多次尝试在不损伤它的情况下对其进行分析，例如多种X射线的扫描，我目前还未能确定这把剑所使用的材料。我们暂时只清楚它是由一种来自外星的金属元素通过灵能量打制而成的，并且其内部也储藏有灵能，原理不明。 但总而言之，这把武器对于战士和学者来说都是一件宝物。-理查德·泰根
Having seen the aliens manipulating Psionic fields for a variety of purposes, we've theorized it may be possible to traverse through the physical confines of our world by developing a Psionic field enmeshed in a specially designed light armor suit. -> 我们已经知道外星人能将灵能力场运用于各种情况，因此，我们得出结论，只要能将灵能力场附着在特制的轻型护甲上，穿戴者便可自由地穿越各种障碍。

Having survived the alien assault on XCOM HQ, a broken-down Central Officer Bradford has been living in the fringes since that harrowing day. Now a year or so later, Central has fallen in with a few hardy souls doing what they can to survive the spreading alien occupation. Spurred on by the thought of finding any remnants of his beloved XCOM, Central sets off with his new friends following a map of unknown origin. -> 在从外星人对XCOM总部的突袭中侥幸逃生后，筋疲力尽的军事中心长官布拉德福德便踏上了逃亡之路。过了一年左右，军事官碰巧遇到了一些挣扎于外星人侵略的勇敢士兵，出于对XCOM的留恋，军事官和他的新朋友们根据一张出处不明的地图的指示，踏上了新的征程。
Having the Commander around seems to have given the resistance a morale boost, not to mention our crew. I don't think I've ever seen Bradford this happy. Even though he and the Commander both know and trust Cato from before the war, I'm withholding my judgment for now. As much as the resistance needs our help, we need their support just as much. -> 指挥官在的话会给反抗军很大的鼓舞，更别说我们的船员了。我从未见过布拉德福德这么兴奋过。虽然他和指挥官在战前就认识且信任加藤，但我仍持保留意见。反抗军有多需要我们的帮助，我们就多渴望他们的支持。

I could not begin to fathom a guess at this point. There exists no research that would ever warrant this... -> 我现在还无法妄加猜测。目前没有研究可以证明这个...

I find it truly remarkable how adaptable some of the alien species' genetics are to the constant \"tweaks\" they're often subjected to. In the case of the \"Viper,\" a species once identified as the infiltration unit known as a \"Thin Man,\" the aliens have made a conscious reduction in their efforts to disguise its true form. Without the introduction of extensive human genetic material, the Viper reverts to a purely reptilian form while apparently retaining the same intellect and combat aptitude. The Viper's snake-like form is in many ways similar to the legless reptiles we commonly encounter on Earth. The enhanced torso musculature allows for upright mobility, and the addition of two physically weak but capable arms allows for the handling of traditional weaponry. Of the many alien species our troops encounter in the field, I find the prospect of encountering an intelligent snake standing over 2 meters tall to be among the most disturbing. R. Tygan. -> 一些外星生物的基因对他们经常遭受的\"扭转\"有很强适应力，我认为这一点值得我们留意。例如，\"毒蛇怪\"曾经被以为是一个叫\"黑衣人\"的渗透部队，因为外星人故意掩盖它的真正形态。不大量使用人类基因材料后，毒蛇怪回到了纯粹的爬虫形态，但也保留了同样的智力和作战能力。毒蛇怪蛇的形态在很多方面都和我们在地球上经常见的无脚爬虫类动物相似。增强过的躯干肌肉组织让它可以直立移动，看似柔弱的双臂也足以使用传统武器。战场上这么多外星生物中，我觉得拥有智能站起来又有两米多高的毒蛇最麻烦。理查德·泰根。
I find it unusual, to say the least, that the subject so often referred to in the past as the "Thin Man" has now been revealed to actually be a genetic derivative of this wholly reptilian creature. -> 我发现这很不寻常，至少可以这么说，这些在过去一直被叫做黑衣人的东西现在已经通过基因演变完全变成了爬行生物。
I find myself questioning the Elders' commitment to your supposed talents, Commander. I have seen no evidence that you are any greater a tactician than I or any other.  -> 我忍不住质疑长老们对你那所谓的才能的肯定了，指挥官。目前看来你在战略上的造诣并不如我。
I find these captives are often eager to share their experiences, once the pressure of disappointing their Commander has been removed from their conscience. -> 这些俘虏一般都很乐于分享他们的经验，只要让他们别去想他们那令人失望的指挥官就行了。
I foresee a number of valuable applications stemming from this technology. I'll have a report assembled as soon as the research is complete. -> 我已预想了多种基于此技术而生的应用。一旦研究完毕我就会通知你。
I generally don't like asking for help, but why turn down the Elders' helping hand? -> 我一般是不需要帮助的，但拒绝长老就太不识相了。
I generally prefer not to collect human specimens, despite what the Elders may do in their spare time. -> 我一般不喜欢收集人类样本，虽然这是长老的爱好。
I got a buddy out there working closely with XCOM, let's call him...Middle Official Stanford. So my friend, Stanford, is out there in the wilds for 20 years, trying to scrape together this Resistance organization without much luck. XCOM is in shambles, his best buddy is captured, the aliens blew up their base, and Brad...I mean, Stanford, is depressed, right? ...oh...hold up...looks like this is to be continued... -> 我收到一个和XCOM有密切合作关系的哥们儿的线报，咱们就叫他...重要线人斯坦福好了。是这样的，我的朋友斯坦福已经在野外活动了20年，一直试图继续反抗事业，但运气始终不佳。XCOM分崩离析，基地被外星人炸毁...布拉德...我是说斯坦福肯定也很绝望对吧？...哦...等等...好像还有后续。

I had always wondered why ADVENT had so many of their churches in the city centers. They must be getting desperate if they're sending the Elders' Priests after us now. -> 我一直好奇变种人建在市中心的教堂是啥样的。连祭司都派出来对付我们了，看来他们已经狗急跳墙了。

I had fully expected to find that the aliens were conducting questionable experiments involving human captives at the "Blacksite" we raided with the help of local resistance operatives. What we did find, was something more reprehensible than I could have possibly imagined. A facility solely dedicated to the rendering and refinement of human genetic material on an industrial scale. The aliens have crossed the boundaries of known science, consequences be damned. -> 在当地反抗军的帮助下我们突袭了\"黑地\"，在这之前我能想象到外星人对那儿的人类俘虏做了一些可疑的实验。但我们实际发现的东西还是大大超出了我能想象到的残忍程度。这个设施完全是以一种流水线的方式利用人类制造并精制人类基因物质。外星人完完全全地过界了，它们应该下地狱。
I had had just about enough of the DJ and his secrets. I was about ready to beat it out of him, but finally he came clean. I wasn't kidding before when I said the guy was a crackpot.

I had hope your kind would never stumble across this facility, Commander.  Some things are best left unknown. -> 我本期望你不会发现这个设施的，指挥官。有些事情还是不知道为好。

I had to expect you'd at least win a few of these little battles, the Elders wouldn't have wasted this much time if you were completely inept. -> 我已经预料到你至少能赢得一两场交锋了，如果你真的一无是处长老就不会在你身上浪费那么多时间了。
I had wanted that to be a little more ceremonious, but we've got something. -> 我本想搞一个仪式的，但我们现在有麻烦。

I cannot judge our fate, but it is assuredly intertwined with the void that approaches.  -> 尽管不知道长老是否意识到，我曾窥探过长老们所能触及的力量。那份力量与他们是密不可分的，是一种超越了常识的存在。虽然我无法看到我们的未来，但我相信我们的未来一定与虚空交缠在一起。
I have managed to secure tactical data and access codes to the ADVENT Network Tower. The Speaker's address will be broadcast live to a global audience via this facility - the whole of ADVENT's network will be listening. -> 我成功截获了他们的战术数据，以及进入变种人网络塔的密码。而发言人的演讲也会通过此设施向全球人民直播；所有的变种人网络都会收到。

I have no fear of your mechanized toys. -> 我可不怕你的机械玩具。

They are as much explorers as they are soldiers, and our fate rests with them. -> 我不知道我们会在通道另一边找到什么，但某种程度上我嫉妒我们的士兵们，因为他们有机会穿过进入另一个世界的大门。他们既是士兵也是探险家，我们的命运依附在他们身上。

I have to admit Commander I didn't think you had it in you. Now be a good human and take the other one down quickly. I have a world to conquer. -> 我得承认，指挥官，我原以为你是没有干掉我们的能耐的。现在再加把劲，把剩下那个也干掉，我还得征服这个世界，没空管这种事。

I'm not sure if we're talkin' about a man or a woman here, but still...have you seen what's been going on?! Just today, he or she kicked the hell out of some ADVENT goons like it was just another day at the park. Ooh, ooh, ooh! -> 或许我不该在直播时提到这个，但...哇哦，我好像快爱上主管XCOM的那个神秘的指挥官了。我是说，我还不确定他到底是男是女，但是大家有看到过他做了什么吗？！他或者她今天又狠狠地教训了外星人一顿，就跟吃饭一样寻常。太、太、太厉害了！

I suppose since that worked we might as well keep it up, Commander. -> 希望今后继续能够顺利完成任务，指挥官。
I suppose that's not bad for a human. -> 对于人类来说，还算可以。
I suppose that's one way to approach a problem you can't solve, just build a machine do it for you. -> 我得承认，建造一个机器来帮你解决问题有时候还挺有用的。
I suppose that's why the Elders want you back on the tactical side, Commander. -> 怪不得长老会想要你当他们的军师，指挥官。
I suppose they need whatever distractions they can find - however simplistic they may be. -> 我想，他们需要任何他们能找到的干扰物--不管多么简单的。
I suppose this is as good a time as any to start testing the defenses. Have to say I'm rooting for you...these things aren't the best conversationalists. -> 看来是时候测试下这儿的防御设施了。我得说我更看好你们...那些东西不太健谈来着。
I suppose we shouldn't be surprised, but I'm not getting any kind of positioning readings from the squad. -> 我想我们用不着大惊小怪的，但我确实没有收到任何来自该小队的位置情报。
I suppose you had to take the shot, but I doubt this is the outcome your comrade was hoping for. -> 我只能说，试总归是要试的，可惜这应该不是你的同志想要看到的结果。
I suppose you owe them the attempt at a rescue, even if ends up being a big mistake. -> 你确实应该尝试营救他们一下，即便这是个错误也无所谓。
I take it this was easier than your last procedure, Doctor? -> 我想这次...要比你上一次手术简单多了，是吗？博士。

I think Tygan's right, someone spent a lot of time designing this facility. -> 我想泰根是对的，肯定有人花了不少时间来设计这间设施。
I think dad would have been proud of what we're doing here. For the first time in a long time, we're actually a threat to the aliens, and they know it. Now we just have to make all those people in the colonies remember what we're fighting for. My father didn't die so we could become a race of cowering test subjects for the aliens to toy with. We just have to get the people's attention. -> 我相信爸爸会对我们现在所做的一切感到骄傲。我们终于第一次真正地对外星人造成威胁，他们也深知这点。我们现在只需要让殖民地的那些人们记住我们是为何而战的。父亲的死不是为了让我们成为让外星人实验的玩物。我们要让人们知道这点。
I think it's also worth mentioning that even a full squadron of Interceptors will do no good against our enemy if we don't know where they are.  Additional satellite coverage will be required before we are able to detect alien craft elsewhere on the planet.  Visit us in Engineering should you wish to build additional satellites. Goodbye, Commander. -> 我认为同样值得一提的是，如果我们不知道敌人的位置，那就算拥有一支完整的拦截机部队也无济于事。在我们有能力侦测地球上其他地方的外星人飞船之前，先需要更广大的卫星监控范围。如果您有意愿建造更多的卫星，请前来工程部找我们。再见，指挥官。
I think we just leveled the playing field... -> 我想我们刚刚扯平了...

I think you quickly come to find that I am no mere prey for you to hunt, Reaper. -> 你很快就会发现我跟你往日的猎物很不一样，死神。
I think you'll find our results have exceeded expectations. -> 可以说，我们获得的成果超出了你的预期。
I thought maybe it was just bad hygiene, but you carry the stink of death on you. Is that why they call you Reapers? -> 一开始我还以为你们是因为不洗澡身上发臭，但现在我才发现你们身上的气息是死亡的气息。这就是你们名字的由来吗？
I thought that would have worked pretty well. Go figure. -> 我还以为一定能成功呢，让我反省反省。

I thought you'd never ask... -> 我还以为你永远不会问...
I told the troops to expect the best, and that's what you've shown them, Commander. Well done. -> 我告诉过军队你是最棒的，而这正是你所展现的，指挥官。做得好。
I told you I was coming. Yet I see you have made no effort to prepare. -> 我说过我会找到你们。你们却没有做任何迎战准备。
I told you I was the best. Now that the others are gone, you won't have to take my word for it. -> 我都告诉过你我是最强的了。你看其他两个都死了，信不信随你。
I took a few hits today, but considering the intel I gathered in the process, I'd say it was worth it. -> 我今天被你们打中过几次，但考虑到我也收集到了大量情报，受伤也值了。

I understand, Commander. -> 明白，指挥官。
I used to love that game when I was kid. -> 小时候我很喜欢那个游戏。
I usually rely on blood trails and slow tracking, but if you're going to leave such a valuable source of intel just lying around, how can I resist? -> 我一般依靠追踪血迹和脚印来定位猎物，但既然你慷慨地把这么珍贵的情报源丢在战场上，我又怎么好意思拒绝呢？
I warned you about digging too deep into the facilities that keep the ADVENT machine running. Something tells me you didn't like what you found in there. -> 我警告过你，不要去深究那些助推变种人计划的设施。我总感觉你并不喜欢你的发现。
I was born of the Elders' own power, of their very essence, to serve as their greatest champion. For the gods have many children, but I am the true instrument of their will, and they instill in me an understanding of their gifts that none other can comprehend. -> 我是长老用自身的精华、自身的力量创造出来的，是他们麾下最为强大的勇士。虽然神明有许多子嗣，但我才是他们意识的真正贯彻者，而他们也赐予了我他人无法驾驭的强大力量。

I was hoping to be the first to get a shot at that ship of yours, but I don't mind being the last either. -> 我还以为我会是第一个有机会攻击那飞船的人呢，但当最后一个也不错。
I was hoping you might take a little longer to find this place. Things were just starting to get interesting between us. Now...you're already dead. -> 我还盼着你们能晚点儿找到这地方呢。咱们本来玩的不是挺开心嘛，可现在...你们全都死定了。
I was hoping you'd make some effort to get your people back, Commander. -> 我就知道你会努力救回自己的人，指挥官。
I was just getting used to having that prisoner around, and here you come with the heroic rescue. That's alright, I got what I needed. -> 我本来都快习惯照顾这个囚犯了，然后他就被你英勇地营救了。没事，我已经得到我需要的情报了。
I was not going to admit it to Shen, but there is one thing that I miss more than my lab equipment... those damn juicy ADVENT burgers. I don't know where they get the meat, and frankly I do not want to know. -> 我不准备向沈承认，但有件东西，我却十分怀念，那就是美味的变种人汉堡。我不知道他们怎么弄到肉的，当然我也不想知道。

I wonder if there's some way we could protect our soldiers from whatever it is the Chosen are doing to them in the field. -> 不知道有没有什么方法能保护战场上的士兵不被天选者入侵大脑。

If you could give 'em a hand, I'm sure they'll be grateful. -> 我这人一般不喜欢欠别人人情，但人命关天，我需要你的帮助。我们的一支支援小队在转移营地时被变种人发现了。他们现在虽然还没死，但被困在一个废弃的城市里 -- 估计很快就会被找到。如果你能帮他们一把，他们肯定会非常感激你的。

I'll admit you surprised me last time around, and that doesn't happen often. -> 我得承认，上次你让我吃了一惊，我可不是个容易吃惊的人。
I'll admit, that was pretty good. -> 我得承认，这任务完成的确实不错。
I'll be interested to hear what this Dr. Tygan thinks the aliens are trying to do in the facility we discovered. The Elders' hacking up and modifying their armies is nothing new, but I've never seen anything like what we found in there. -> 我很有兴趣听听泰根博士对外星人在那个设施里进行的实验的看法。长老经常对他们的军队进行基因调整，但那种东西我还是头回见到。
I'll be the first to admit I may have underestimated you, Commander. I just wasn't entirely sure what the big deal was. But, after putting down one of the Elders' Chosen, permanently, you've shown that you're in this fight till the end. The Reapers owe you one. -> 首先我得承认，我有点低估你了，指挥官。我当初并不敢确定你有什么能耐。但是，你彻底除掉了一位长老的天选者，展示了你真正的实力。死神们会永远感激你。

I'm Central Officer Bradford. My role in this project is twofold - providing tactical support for our field operations, and keeping you briefed on the current situation. My efforts should allow you to focus on the bigger issues at hand.  Speaking of which, we have a soldier waiting for a promotion in the Barracks. I'll let you get to it. -> 我是军事中心长官布拉德福德，我在XCOM计划中有两个重要任务：为我们的战场任务提供策略支持，以及随时向您提供当前形势的报告。我的工作会能使您专注于手边更重要的问题。说到这个，我们有个士兵正在等待晋升，我会带您去兵营了解更多内容。
I'm NOT gonna make it EASY for 'em. -> 我不会让他们觉得容易的。
I'm actually thrilled at the change of scenery...not to mention the smell. We've zeroed in on a crashed skyranger, pre-war. The drive assembly on those things...well, it could be the answer to my prayers. -> 知道能换个好点的工作环境真是让我如释重负...那地方的味道实在是太臭了。我们发现了一台坠毁的天际游侠号飞船，根据初步扫描应该是战争前的产品。上面装着的驱动部件...很可能就是复仇者号急需的部件。
I'm afraid a cursory understanding of Psionics will do little to shield this one from my interrogations.  -> 恐怕对灵能如此浅薄的理解并不能帮助他抵抗我们的审讯。

The nebulous form of its physical structure, including a pliable, semi-solid outer layer, seems to be slowly degrading now that the creature has expired. There is also a pungent odor that only seems to grow stronger as time passes. -> 我无法表达现在遇到的困难。我们的部队叫这个生物无面怪，而我们根本无法掌控它。他的形体是云雾状的，包括一个柔软的半固体外层，现在好像因为其死亡而在渐渐分解。而味道也随着时间变得越来越刺鼻。

I'm curious to see what this one might know of your plans, Commander. I'll find out once we get back to the stronghold. -> 我倒要看看这个士兵知不知道你的计划，指挥官。反正等我们回了总部就清楚了。
I'm detecting high concentrations of a particularly nasty compound spreading throughout that area. I would strongly advise our forces to avoid direct contact. -> 我侦测到该区域内散布有重污染化合物，强烈建议小队成员避免与它们产生直接接触。
I'm everywhere. -> 因为我无处不在。
I'm getting closer every day, Commander. Soon there won't be any place left to hide that ship of yours. -> 我离你越来越近了，指挥官。很快你的飞船就没法再东躲西藏了。
I'm getting closer every day, you've left quite the trail of destruction. At this rate I'll be touring the Avenger in no time. -> 我离你越来越近，你留下的踪迹会导致你的毁灭。这样下去我很快就能找到复仇者号了。
I'm glad to see our joint effort paid off like we hoped. -> 很高兴看到我们的共同努力取得了相应的成果。
I'm glad to see our new recruits aren't hesitating when it comes to taking out the aliens. -> 我很高兴新兵们对除掉外星人这件事毫不犹豫。
I'm glad to see our troops finding success in the field, it's good for the entire crew's morale. -> 我很高兴我们的军队在战场上获胜，这会让我们士气大振的。
I'm glad to see that our cooperation with the Resistance Factions is going so well, Commander. Their soldiers seem to be a big help around here. -> 我很乐意看到我们与其他反抗军派系的合作进展的非常顺利，指挥官。他们的士兵帮了我们不少忙。
I'm glad to see the resistance has their new recruits training, they need to be prepared for the next ADVENT sweep of this area. -> 我很高兴反抗军能够训练新人，他们必须准备好抵抗这一区域下一次变种人的清扫。
I'm glad to see you've established contact with the local resistance, Commander. They should be able to assist you in assessing the alien facility. -> 很高兴了解到你已经联络上了本地的反抗军，指挥官。他们应该能帮助你进入到外星人的设施里面。
I'm glad you finally decided to take that prisoner off my hands, maybe next time you'll be more careful about leaving them out in the first place. -> 很高兴你决定从我手上救走这个囚犯了，或许下次你该小心点，别再把他们丢下了。
I'm goin' for the door! -> 我去开门！
I'm gonna take your corpse back to the Elders myself! -> 我要亲自把你们的尸体带给长老！
I'm guessing that won't be easy. -> 我想那不会很容易。
I'm guessing that's our man--well our contact anyway. -> 那应该就是我们的人 -- 准确说是联络人了。
I'm guessing that's our man--well our contact anyway. Outrider is already en route, let's not keep her waiting. -> 那应该就是我们的接头人--或者说接应人了。先行者已经出发，不要让她等太久了。
I'm guessing you'd rather get this one back alive, am I right, Commander? Maybe if you're lucky. -> 你应该想把他活着救回来，不是吗，指挥官？运气好的话说不定能办到。
I'm having a vision. -> 我看到了。
I'm hoping that was just nerves and not a sign of things to come. -> 希望这只是偶然，而不是必然。
I'm hoping that's a good thing. -> 希望这是个好兆头。
I'm hoping there may be some more useful code in its data core...which is why I volunteered to lead the operation myself. I'd love to elaborate here, but I need to hurry, I have a mission to prep. -> 我一直希望能获得外星人飞船的数据核心的代码...所以我自告奋勇指挥这项行动。虽然我很想说明具体情况，但我还得为任务做准备，时间不多了。
I'm hot on your trail, Commander. A few more pieces to this little puzzle and I'll be there before you know it. -> 我已经锁定你了，指挥官。再来一点线索，等你回过神来我已经到你家门口了。
I'm impressed, I've always found those extra-dimensional beings to be especially irritating to hunt down. -> 你们干得不错啊，这些界外生物狩猎起来还是挺麻烦的。
I'm intrigued by the idea that despite the Codex's best efforts to resist our intrusion into the ADVENT network, we somehow came away with a set of coordinates leading to an otherwise uninhabited region. The aliens certainly keep us on the move, one way or another. -> 我感到很好奇，尽管原典竭力阻止我们侵入变种人网络，我们还是通过一系列坐标找到了另一个无人区。外星人们在某种程度上还算帮了我们。
I'm just testing the waters. -> 我不过是在试试水。
I'm keeping tabs on all of our operations, Commander. Our people are standing by for your orders.  -> 我在实时跟踪工作进展，指挥官。我们的人随时准备为您效劳。
I'm lookin' for ya. -> 我就喜欢捉迷藏。
I'm more than happy to prove 'em wrong. -> 我很高兴他们猜错了答案。
I'm not all that happy about it, but one of my best people has decided to come join your crew after that last covert action. -> 虽然我不是很乐意，但我方一位最强的部下在上次隐秘行动后决定加入你们。
I'm not big on surprises, and yet somehow I didn't see this coming. -> 我不是一个容易感到惊讶的人，但你这次确实让我惊讶了一把。
I'm not big on taking prisoners, but since you keep leaving them out in the open for me, how can I pass up the opportunity? -> 我虽然并不喜欢抓俘虏，但你老把他们大摇大摆地丢在战场上，我又怎能错过这样的机会？
I'm not entirely sure how my people slipped up, but ADVENT caught wind of one of our specialists and their escort moving between camps. They're holed up in the old city, but the aliens are still in pursuit. If you can get them outta there, I'm sure they'd be more than happy to help out on that ship of yours. -> 我虽然不清楚我的部下是怎么露出马脚的，但变种人收到消息，知道了我们的专家和护送他的小队会在何时进行转移。他们目前被困在这座旧城中，但外星人依旧紧跟在他们屁股后面。如果你能把他们从那里弄出来，相信他们肯定会非常乐意登上你那艘飞船与你共事吧。
I'm not entirely sure what I'll do with this world once the Elders' go about their merry way. It might make for an interesting game reserve, maybe I'll just turn whoever survives loose on each other and see how it goes. -> 我其实不是很清楚我摆弄完这个世界会拿它做什么。或许我应该把它当成一个狩猎场，又或者让幸存者互相杀戮，看看最后谁能活下来。
I'm not goin out like that! -> 我才不要那样出去！
I'm not gonna pretend to know exactly what's going on here, but I'm pretty sure that thing was sent here to stop this alliance from ever taking place. Let's not give her the satisfaction. -> 虽然我不想不懂装懂，但我很确定那玩意儿是被长老派来阻止我们结盟的。可不能让她得逞啊。
I'm not happy about the beating you put on me today, but at least this soldier I'm taking with me will tell me all about your future plans. -> 虽然我不喜欢被你打伤，但至少今天被我抓住的那个士兵会告诉我你未来的计划。
I'm not much of an interrogator, but your troops gave up everything they knew without much trouble last time around. -> 我的拷问技术虽然一般，但上次还是没花多少功夫就让你的士兵开口泄密了。
I'm not nearly as easy to beat as my siblings are, so don't get any funny ideas just 'cause you took one of them down. -> 我可不像我的兄弟姐妹那样羸弱，所以说别因为击败了其中一位就沾沾自喜。
I'm not sure how the rest of the crew would feel if they knew how many bandages I've had to put on this ship. A little luck goes a long way when you don't have much to work with, but I'm worried about what might happen if we push her too hard. -> 我不清楚别的船员如果知道我给这艘船贴了那么多补丁会作何感想。当你不用操心太多事的时候往往会有好运相伴，但我有点担心假使我们操之过急会带来什么后果。
I'm not sure they have to do all that much convincing at this point. -> 我不确定他们为何在这时候还如此卖力地宣传。
I'm not sure what Central may have told you, but we found something while removing you from the alien stasis suit. -> 我不知道军事官有没有告诉你，我们在把你从外星静滞护甲内弄出来的时候找到了一些东西。
I'm not sure what the Elders expect me to do with a planet full of their pet projects. I'm not looking to run a zoo. -> 我是不太明白长老为什么要给我个满是他们实验宠物的星球。我又不想经营动物园。
I'm not sure what we were expecting to find out here, but this definitely looks promising. -> 我不确定我们来这会找到什么，但是现在看来确实有所发现。
I'm not sure who out there in Resistance land caught a clip of that fight today, but I don't think I've ever seen anything like that before. Our pals over at XCOM put a beat down on the aliens so bad those creepy green tubes they were born in are probably still shakin'! They keep this up, we might just win this thing. -> 我虽然不确定今天战斗的是反抗军的哪一支小队，但他们是我见过的最猛的家伙。我们XCOM的伙计们今天把那些外星人打得求爷爷叫奶奶，恨不得逃回他们的那绿色的培养皿里躲起来！只要我们能保持这个势头，那还真有可能赢得这场战争。
I'm not sure you even know the kind of power you've got there. -> 我看你根本无法理解灵能。
I'm not sure you have the talent to properly wield that weapon. -> 我可不认为你拥有使用那把武器的才能。
I'm on it, Commander. -> 我在做了，指挥官。
I'm on it. -> 正在行动。
I'm on my way -> 行动中
I'm pleased with the research advances we've made so far, but there's still so much more to learn about the alien's motivations. -> 我对于目前的试验进展感到满意，但外星人的目的还有许多地方值得研究。
I'm ready and waiting. So go ahead, Commander. Impress me. -> 我准备好了。来吧，指挥官，让我见识下你的能耐。
I'm sending you a new sequence now. -> 我现在把最新序列传给你。
I'm so enjoying this little game of ours, I take your soldier captive, and sure enough you swoop in for the daring rescue. The question is, what happens next? -> 我们的这场游戏还真是让我过了把瘾，我活捉了你的士兵，然后你从天而降展开大胆营救。问题是，接下来会发生什么？
I'm still amazed anyone in the resistance agreed to work with you Skirmishers. Why would anyone trust a faction built on disloyalty? -> 真不明白为什么反抗军里会有人愿意跟散兵合作。一支由叛徒组成的部队怎么让人信任他们？
I'm still not entirely sure what the aliens hope to accomplish by banning livestock and domesticated animals. They seem genuinely concerned about the risk of having these animals intermingling with the population. -> 我依旧不清楚外星人禁止牲畜和驯养动物的原因是什么。它们看起来很担心让这些动物和人类在一起的情况。
I'm still unsure as to why the aliens have dedicated so much time towards the aesthetic advancement of these Archons. For whatever reason, they seem to place a heavy emphasis on appearances. -> 我仍然不明白为什么外星人花这么多时间让这些执政官看起来更高级更符合审美价值。但不管什么原因，他们似乎很强调外表。
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough. -> 我确定我们很快就能查明。
I'm sure we'll see them again, but that Chosen sure wasn't expecting the fight we put up today, Commander. -> 虽然我估计我们很快就会再见到他，但他肯定没料到我们今天的攻势会这么凶猛，指挥官。
I'm the best there is. -> 我永远都是最棒的。
I'm the only one left, somehow you managed to kill off the other two. I'll admit, you've got my attention. -> 只剩我一个天选者了，没想到你真的能杀掉那两个家伙。我得承认，你引起了我的注意。
I'm tracking our current operational objectives here. If you need a more detailed breakdown, I have everything patched through to the Archive terminal in your quarters. Looks like you won't have time for that just yet though, we're picking up an incoming transmission from the resistance, sounds like they've got some new information for us. -> 我正在查看我们当前的任务目标。如果你需要更详细的报告，我已经把所有的内容放进了指挥舱里的档案中。尽管现在你看起来没时间，但我们正接入一个来自反抗军的信息，听起来他们有新消息提供给我们。
I'm usually not one to take prisoners, but if you make it as easy as last time, how can I resist? -> 我一般不抓俘虏，但上次你几乎是把他拱手奉上，这叫我如何拒绝？
I'm waiting for you. -> 我在等你们。
I'm warning you, if you insist on sending your people in there Commander, you'll be bringing them home in pieces. -> 我警告你，如果你坚持派你的士兵来这儿，指挥官，那你就等着给他们收尸吧。
I'm watching you. -> 我注视着你。
I've already learned so much about your plans, this won't take nearly as long as I had envisioned.  -> 我已经获取了大量有关你计划的情报，比我想象的要省事的多。
I've always wondered who ADVENT employs to design their vehicles and equipment, they're definitely got the intimidating aesthetics down pat. -> 我总是好奇变种人会用什么样的人来设计他们的载具和装备，因为他们的审美观从来令人不敢恭维。
I've been digging through some of the old data files Central has been holding on to since before the war. I keep running across notes scrawled in English and what looks like broken German. I should probably ask him about it. -> 我还在研究军事官在战争之前保存的资料。这些笔记都是用英文或者一些支离破碎的德文潦草书写的。我也许应该直接去问问军事官。
I've come to suspect that this creature's unusual appearance is somehow directly connected to its notable Psionic aptitude. The aliens always have some reasoning to their actions, even as twisted as it is often revealed to be. -> 我怀疑这种生物奇特的外表是灵能的产物。外星人总是觉得自己的行为是合理的，甚至包括那些扭曲的不正常的行为。
I've done what I can do aid our troops, but obviously, it hasn't been enough. -> 我做了所有能为军队做的，但很明显，这还不够。
I've enjoyed watching your kind adapt in the face of insurmountable odds.  -> 我就喜欢你们这种克服逆境不断进取的精神。
I've got a bad feeling about this. -> 我有不祥的预感。
I've got a better idea. -> 我有个更好的主意。
I've got a few Psionic tricks of my own you know. -> 我其实也会几招灵能秘技。
I've got a few big brains in my organization, you never know when they might come up with some new recipe. If you feel like collaborating, I'm sure they'd be happy to toss some of our folksy wisdom your way. -> 我的组织里有几个聪明人，他们时不时地会搞出点儿新玩意儿来。你要是愿意合作，他们肯定乐意给你们几个新发明耍耍。
I've got a few toys of my own. -> 我还是有那么几个玩具的。
I've got a reputation to maintain, Commander, and I can't just let you run me off like last time. -> 我可是很看重自己的名声的，指挥官，我不会像上次那样落荒而逃了。
I've got help coming, Commander. -> 我的援军来了，指挥官。
I've got my eye on you. -> 我盯上你了。
I've got something for you. -> 我有东西要送你。
I've got the drop on 'em - -> 我看到他们了。
I've got the ones who made it out; lifting off. -> 我接到了那些成功逃出的人，正在起飞。
I've gotta hand it to the aliens, the invasion was one thing, all their advanced technology, they had the drop on us for sure. But ADVENT, they're something we could never have prepared for, even with better gear. Between the propaganda, the handouts, and a seemingly endless supply of reinforcing "peacekeepers," they're nothing but trouble for an upstart resistance movement. -> 我必须承认外星人的长处，侵略是一码事，而他们的先进技术就是另一回事了，他们领先我们太多。即使有了更加先进的装备，变种人也是从未预料到的东西。那些宣传标语，宣传册以及来自于维和者看起来无穷无尽的支援对于抵抗运动来说完全就是阻碍。
I've had a chance to take a closer look at some of the ADVENT weapons recovered from the field. The alloy used in their frames is significantly lighter, making them more suited to the human form. I'm guessing it's the same material we've seen them using all over the colonies, but they'd have to be producing it from something here on Earth, they seem to have an endless supply of the stuff. -> 我有幸近距离看到过战场上回收来的变种人的部分武器。框体里用到的合金比我们明显要轻很多，对他们的人类形态更加适合。我猜应该和他们在所有殖民地使用的材质相同--但他们应该使用的是地球上的某种材质，因为他们似乎有源源不断的类似补给。
I've had a lot time to come up with these tricks. -> 这些招数是我花了不少时间想出来的。
I've had to do more than that. Even detached, it's still capable of sending low-power transmissions. I'm storing it in a makeshift Faraday cage that should prevent the aliens from tracking it. Shen is the only person with access. -> 不仅如此。相隔那么远它还能发出低能量讯息。我把它藏在一个临时的法拉第笼里以避免外星人追踪到它。只有沈博士有权限接触到它。
I've heard a lot about your ship, or should I say our ship. It was never really intended for combat, but you've done pretty well considering. -> 我听过不少有关你们的飞船，或者应该说，我们的飞船的情报。它原本并不是用来战斗的，但你倒是完美发挥出了它的潜力。
I've killed everything that ever walked or crawled. You think they'll be any different? -> 我杀过的生物应有尽有，你凭什么以为你的手下就能有所不同？
I've lost count at this point. -> 我都记不清我杀过几个人类了。
I've lost power! We're goin' down fast! -> 我们在失去动力！正在快速下坠！
I've made a number of interesting discoveries, Commander.  -> 我有了不少有趣的发现，指挥官。
I've managed to break down several key components of the "chip" implanted into your skull. My analysis reveals that its primary function was that of a conduit, passing a vast amount of data directly to your cerebral cortex. -> 我成功地分析了一些在你头颅里植入的\"芯片\"的关键组成。我的分析显示，它的主要功能类似一个导管，直接向你的大脑皮层传输了大量的数据。
I've marked the location Shen pulled from the Codex, Commander. It's a remote region, out in the woods away from any populated areas. We'll need to contact the local resistance forces if we want to get a closer look. -> 我已经标记出了沈从原典中取得的坐标，指挥官。它很远，远离人烟。如果我们想进一步调查就得先同当地反抗军取得联系。
I've never been one for hiding, Commander, even when the odds were against us. If we have an opportunity to strike first, I think we should take it. -> 我从来就不是一个喜欢躲躲藏藏的人，指挥官，即使在条件对我们非常不利的情况下也不例外。如果我们有能够先行进攻的机会就不应该放弃。
I've never seen anything like this -- the Codex is projecting multiple copies of itself into our dimension! -> 我从未见过这样的--原典将它自身的多个副本映射到我们的维度上来！
I've often wondered how the aliens could conceive of such a being. Is there another world out there, filled with these shapeshifting creatures? Or are they merely another construct of alien genetic tampering? -> 我一直想知道外星人是如何创造这种生物的，难道还有另一个世界，那个世界里都是这种变形生物吗？或者他们仅仅是外星人另一个基因干预的产物？
I've patched the Shadow Chamber directly into the ship's computer. -> 我已经将暗影舱直接连到飞船的电脑了。
I've seen less human casualties at an ADVENT gene therapy clinic. Keep up the good work, Commander. -> 知道么，变种人的基因诊疗所的人类伤亡比这还少 -- 你还是继续努力吧，指挥官。
I've seen members of the crew quietly glancing at the scar on my neck. If I wasn't forced to remove the chip myself, the incisions might have been cleaner. -> 我发现一些船员会偷偷瞄一眼我脖子后面的那道移除芯片留下的疤痕。假如我不是被迫自己移除芯片的话，切口会更干净些。
I've started to wonder how the ADVENT administration views our current band of renegades. Do they see us as an actual threat, or more of a nuisance?  -> 我有点想知道变种人管理层怎么看我们这帮变节者的。他们会把我们当做真正的威胁，或是一群捣蛋鬼吗？
I've studied the footage from your last battle with my sibling, Commander. Are you even trying to win this war? If it's defeat you want I am happy to oblige. -> 我研究过记录下你和我的同胞战斗的视频了，指挥官。我说你到底想不想打胜仗？诚心想输那找我帮你好了。
I've tracked my prey across time itself, do you really think there's any place you can hide from me on this world? -> 为追踪猎物我连时间都穿越过，你觉得自己还能跑到哪去？
I've updated our latest operational objectives, Commander.  -> 指挥官，我已经更新了最新的任务列表。
I've warned the crew to stay away from the ADVENT meat rations; we still don't know what they're putting in that stuff. -> 我有警告过船员们要远离变种人的肉类配给；我们根本不知道他们会在肉里放些什么。
I... cannot hear them clearly! -> 我...听不清他们了！

INTEL BRIEF:\n\n\"Of the three Chosen created by the Elders, the Warlock is said to be the oldest, the first of their attempts at harnessing the latent Psionic potential of humanity. Unflinchingly loyal, the Warlock believes himself to be the true favored child of the Elders and tolerates little in the way of disobedience or disrespect towards his masters. In battle, he is a champion of Psionic power, wielding it with a degree of confidence not seen outside of the Elders themselves. He has taken a particular interest in the Templar faction, as they attempt to reclaim the power of humanity that he himself expects to harness as his reward for serving the Elders.\"\n\nADVANCED INTEL SEQUENCED FOR ADVENT CHOSEN \"WARLOCK\"\n\nFILE 209858: PARTIAL DATA RECOVERED FROM ADVENT NETWORK BREACH 2026.08.17\n\n\"...child exhibits exceptional Psionic tendencies; initial recovery team suffered 94% casualties during first encounter despite limited engagement.

By the time I got there, the whole clinic was flooded with Psionic energy, I couldn't even get close. I can only speculate, but I have to guess the doctor must have tried to break the infusion cycle. Whatever he did, something changed in there...I saw \"O\" inside, free from the chamber... but he wasn't trying to escape. He was just standing there... laughing.

INTEL BRIEF:\n\n\"The second of the Chosen created by the Elders, the Hunter was designed to be an unequaled military tactician, one able to predict and defeat the increasing number of guerrilla attacks conducted against ADVENT by the Resistance. He has long pursued the Reaper faction, his arrival coinciding with the disappearance of one of their greatest operatives. The Hunter has an uncanny familiarity with the Reapers and their methods, leading some among the group to believe that he is in fact their long-missing operative. However, most among their people will insist it's only a trick of the Elders intended to demoralize the Resistance.\"\n\nADVANCED INTEL SEQUENCED FOR ADVENT CHOSEN \"HUNTER\"\n\nFILE: 213546 RECONSTRUCTED TRANSLATION FROM ADVENT OFFICER SKULLJACK DATA 2028.02.14\n\n\"Assignment: Stationary guard posting; City Center 47, Gene Therapy Clinic A-2, Theta-B Secure Lab.

Now approaching the end of his second conditioning pass, including full access to the ADVENT tactical archive, our subject has shown an overall retention rate well above accepted returns. Although initially scheduled for five complete passes before field trials, I believe it may be an unnecessary delay in his progress.

INTEL BRIEF:\n\n\"The third and final Chosen created by the Elders, the Assassin was their final attempt at creating a warrior capable of fulfilling their vision in battle, while still remaining both loyal and focused. Trained in the sword, she is a deadly melee combatant who relies heavily on stealth and shadow to neutralize her targets. Initially tasked with hunting the Skirmishers who escaped from ADVENT's control, somehow their leader Betos and her right hand Mox slipped through the Assassin's grasp. Having failed her masters, the Assassin is driven to reconcile for her mistake through XCOM's defeat and the return of their Commander.\"\n\nADVANCED INTEL SEQUENCED FOR ADVENT CHOSEN \"ASSASSIN\"\n\nFILE 215903: DATA RECONSTRUCTION FROM ADVENT NETWORK INCURSION 2029.04.15\n\n\"Although the accelerated growth rate exhibited by subject \"F\" is on par with expectations for cloned individuals using current methodology, expectations for the readiness of her final form may be optimistic to say the least. While all efforts have been made under the current doctrine to avoid the intrinsic issues found in past subjects \"O\" and \"T,\" the additional care required is inherently more time consuming than the previous developments. If our highest priority is to instill an utmost respect for the Elders' authority, then we must put that before all other concerns.\"\n\nFILE 215907-PHYSICAL: DATAPAD RECOVERED DURING FACILITY RAID 2029.06.06\n\n\"...she has so far performed beyond expectations in terms of the current doctrine's goal of respect and focus before all else. She has shown no signs of deviation from her intended tasks or targets, and when required her judgement has proven both sound and fair in carrying out the Elders' will. Should her development continue along these lines, I'm confident she will quickly grow to become the favored child of the Elders.\"\n\nCOMM 478A: THETA LEVEL SECURITY DISPATCH TO ALL ADVENT FORCES INTERCEPTED 2029.09.06\n\n\"THETA PRIORITY ALERT: BY MEANS UNKNOWN MULTIPLE ADVENT UNITS OF VARYING DESIGNATION HAVE BROKEN THEIR LINK TO THE ELDERS AND BETRAYED OUR FORCES. ANY ADVENT UNIT FOUND TO BE SEPARATED SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY TERMINATED WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE. FAILURE TO REPORT MISSING OR NONCOMPLIANT UNITS WILL BE CONSIDERED COLLABORATION.\"\n\nCOMM478-A: ADVENT NETWORK TRAFFIC INTERRUPT FRAGMENT DETECTED 2029.09.07\n\n\"ADVENT SPEAKER: Her failure has left the Elders questioning. Such promise, now exposed as weakness. To have allowed our public face, members of own peacekeeping force, to abandon their posts and escape into the wilds. It is all but inexcusable. And now, she is nearly as lost to the Elders as her siblings, as her once incorruptible focus has now turned towards redemption at all costs. She will require more careful scrutiny now, just as the others, and our masters will be forced to expend even more of their energy to keep these children in check.\"\n\nCOMM-P310-BETOS-B-SECURE-LINK REF: "BUTCHER" 2030.00.00\n\n\"The one you speak of is known by many names among my kind, the Butcher of Freed ADVENT, the Unrelenting One, the Elders' Assassin. From the beginning, from my earliest memories free of the Elders' grasp, the Assassin was there in pursuit. The fact that I still live today brings her endless shame, a small gift of knowledge that has come to bring me satisfaction I had not known before. Unfortunately many of my kind were not so lucky. Most who have seen her face in battle have not lived to speak of it.

Initially conceived of as a means to defend against unforeseen threats to the Earth as a whole, the XCOM project was first outlined during secretive planning sessions conducted throughout the year 1993. Although these early discussions were only meant to establish the theoretical principles of defense against an unknown enemy, all agreed upon preparations were carried out by the participating Council nations immediately. For more than two decades, the project remained dormant, with limited personnel records maintained by an agreed upon representative of the Council.\n\nIn February of 2015, long distance scans indicated a number of large unidentified objects on a slow approach towards Earth. As agreed upon, the XCOM project was activated on February 10th, with key personnel assignments filled by the latest active candidates on file. In less than two months' time, open hostilities between the aliens and Earth's forces ravaged much of the planet's developed world leaving the survivors desperate and alone. -> XCOM计划源于1993年的联合国机密会议，最初只是个联合各国政府抗击未知威胁的设想。会议原先只打算在理论上构建一个共同战线，没想到最终拟定的条款被理事会参与国一致通过。20多年来，该计划都处于休眠状态，只由联合国指派的极少数人员维护。\n\n2015年2月，远距离扫描装置检测到大量不明飞行物向地球进发。于是，XCOM计划于2月10日正式启动，先前的维护人员开始选拔XCOM正式成员。不到2个月的时间里，这场外星人与地球武装的战争摧毁了这颗星球上多数的发达国家，最终只留下一些孤独绝望的幸存者。

Secure the site and eliminate all hostile contacts. -> 虽然有点费事，但是很显然，反抗军还是设法破坏了这架幽浮。不幸的是，外星人的增援很快就抵达了，所以他们没能在飞船上找到什么。我们去看看还能有什么发现，消灭敌军并控制该区域。

It would be harder to deny our people their chance at vengeance, than it will be to facilitate their just retribution. -> 阻止我们部队的复仇反而要比帮助我们困难。

It would seem ADVENT has begun deploying their so-called "Priests" into combat. Their implants provide significant enhancements to whatever latent Psionic energy they may have once possessed. -> 看样子变种人最近开始部署它们那些所谓的祭司到战区了。它们身体内的植入物能够有效提升潜在的灵能力量。

It's been slow going, but I've made headway interfacing our equipment with the alien technology still embedded throughout the ship.

My hope is to use the best of both worlds to come up with something new, something the aliens won't expect. -> 虽说进展还比较慢，但是我已尝试将我们的设备与在飞船上使用的外星科技相连接。大多数的主要系统在两者的结合下现在都能正常运转。我希望结合两个世界最好的东西，创造出新的设备--外星人都想象不到的设备。
It's better than nothing, but see if you can't find a safer position further out. -> 总比什么掩护都没有强。但还是看看你能不能找到更安全的地点。
It's clear the Elders have used these portals to bring their endless armies into our world, returning with whatever they would pillage from our people. It may be best to destroy these gateways where they stand. -> 很显然长老就是用这些传送门源源不断地把他们的军队运送到我们的世界里，再派他们夺走我们人类的财产。我建议就地摧毁这些传送门。

It's ripping itself apart!  Shut it down, now!  It could destroy the whole base! -> 它正在撕裂自己！ 现在就关闭！ 它可能摧毁整座基地！
It's safe to assume ADVENT didn't just build this system overnight. It must have taken years to assemble this kind of operation. It may have been the aliens' motivation all along. -> 我可以断定变种人并不是一夜之间就完成了这个系统，这样的工程得花上好几年。外星人应该已经蓄谋已久了。
It's taken 20 years to get the ball rolling on this resistance, and we can't expect to win it all overnight.

No worries though, we're all rootin' for ya. -> 距离反抗军开始活动已经过了20年，我们也不能指望他们一夜之间完全胜利。根据我获得的信息，今天XCOM的行动进展得很不顺利，看来他们得重新考虑一下战术了。不过请他们不必担心，我们会永远支持他们的。

It's turning into a massacre out there, Commander, the aliens are wiping out the camp! -> 指挥官，这已经变成一次大屠杀了，营地马上要被外星人夷为平地了！
It's unfortunate we missed this opportunity to strike back at ADVENT in <XGParam:StrValue0/!WorldRegionName/>, Commander. Although the aliens will continue to advance their operations, I trust you will find other ways to impede their progress going forward. -> 很不幸我们错失了在<XGParam:StrValue0/!WorldRegionName/>反击变种人的机会，指挥官。虽然外星人会继续他们的行动，我相信你会找到其他手段来阻止他们的。

My initial curiosity and excitement regarding our earlier discoveries involving the recovered alien data have been all but extinguished by the disturbing results of my latest tests. Having analyzed the composition of the green-hued substance retrieved from the ADVENT Blacksite, I can only draw one conclusion - that the facility was designed solely for the refinement and production of concentrated genetic material - human genetic material.\n\nWith the entirety of our ship's systems dedicated to my analysis, I found that the single vial we recovered contains the unique human genomes of over one million subjects. One million people, convinced to join the ADVENT cities out of desperation, then subjected to appalling experiments that eventually cost them their lives. To what end, I can only imagine. R. Tygan. -> 我对最初我们从外星人数据中的发现的好奇和激动，都被最近试验中让人心烦的结果所浇灭。分析完从变种人黑地回收而来的绿色物质的构造后，我只能做出这样一个结论：该设施单单被设计成去提炼和制造浓缩的基因材料，人类基因材料。\n\n在我们整个舰船系统对我分析的帮助下，我发现我们回收的一个小瓶就包含上百万个独特的人类基因组。一百万人，在绝望中被说服进入变种人城市，接着就遭受骇人听闻的试验，最终被夺去生命。出于什么目的，我只能靠想象了。理查德·泰根。

Officially designated as a \"Purifier\" unit among ADVENT's various field-deployed personnel, these hybrid soldiers appear to have been specifically designed and equipped for high-temperature exposure. In the field, the Purifier is unique in its exclusive wielding of a portable flamethrower, no doubt ADVENT's direct response to the increasing number of Lost that seem to be overtaking the outlying territories.\n\nHowever, despite their often-times reckless use of these flammable materials, the Purifier is seemingly immune to the intense heat and even direct exposure to the flames that accompany their gruesome work. Although I would have initially hypothesized that much of this tolerance comes from the design of their armor, my autopsy has revealed something else entirely.\n\nWhile a cursory examination would have us believe that the Purifiers are no different from the other humanoid ADVENT forces, this is not the case. The skin of the Purifier is wholly unique--whereas we might find 10 to 20 layers of interwoven cells in a typical human--the outermost epidermal layer of the Purifier is nearly three times that thickness in any given area of their body, with an unusual capacity for both absorption and retention of moisture.\n\nWorking in conjunction with armor specifically designed to support this function by pulling moisture from the surrounding atmosphere, the Purifier is essentially immune to the oppressive heat generated by their own weaponry. While I would be remiss to praise the aliens for their questionable practices, I must admit their ingenuity in approaching these targeted genetic manipulations is nothing short of exceptional. -R. Tygan. -> 这些被从变种人军队中挑选出来，任命为\"净化者\"的混血士兵似乎经过特殊的基因调整和装备调配，能够承受极高的温度。净化者在战场上使用的武器是一种便携式的火焰喷射器，毫无疑问是变种人用来应对最近不断涌现且侵占不少外围区域的失魂者的手段。 \n\n然而，尽管它们使用起易燃材料来非常粗心，但它们自身似乎能免疫热量，甚至直接接触火焰都不会烧伤。虽然我原先认为这是它们护甲设计的功劳，但解剖结果却出乎了我的意料。\n\n乍看下来，净化者和其余人形变种人没有任何区别，然而并不是这样。净化者的皮肤是与众不同的--紧密交织的细胞要比普通的人类多10至20倍--也就是说它们的表皮细胞比身体的其余部分厚实得多，拥有惊人的吸收并储藏水分的能力。\n\n再搭配上它们那拥有吸收大气中水分的能力的护甲，净化者对它们武器所制造的致命热能是几乎免疫的。尽管我绝不会认同外星人的行事作风，但我得承认他们在基因操作领域的确是无人能及。-理查德·泰根

On both the physical and genetic level, the ADVENT Stun Lancers are nearly identical to the Troopers our forces regularly see in combat. However, a minor yet crucial adjustment to the muscle fiber density of the Lancer improves both agility and overall survivability. Equipped with non-lethal weapons capable of easily disabling human targets, these Lancers were first deployed during the earliest days following ADVENT's establishment of the city centers, when civil unrest was a more common problem than outright Resistance. In studying their usage and deployment, this raised an interesting question - if the Lancers were among the first ADVENT forces deployed, and their survivability is somewhat higher than that of the standard Trooper - did the aliens consciously reduce the Trooper's strength based on their assessment of human combat readiness? This would imply a system of rapid genetic modification beyond what I had previously imagined the aliens were capable of. It would also demonstrate a degree of \"genetic frugality\" that I would have previously assumed was irrelevant to the aliens, based on the variety of unusual experiments they've conducted. R. Tygan. -> 在身体和基因层面，变种人强袭枪兵和战场上我们看到的军队几乎完全一样。但是，一个看似不起眼却关键的肌肉纤维密度调整改善了他们的灵活性和整体生存能力。他们装备着非致命性但可使人类单位休眠的武器，最早被使用在变种人市中心建立不久之后，那时内乱比直接的抵抗来的还要严重。经过研究他们的用途用法，就可以得出一个有趣的问题，如果强袭枪兵属于首批使用的变种人军队，而他们的生存能力要高出标准的士兵，那么外星人是根据他们对人类的斗争意识强弱判断来自行降低标准军队的强度吗？这就暗示着他们的基因修改系统比我预料的更加快速。同时还展示出了他们有使用\"基因简化\"，我本来以为这和外星人没有关系，因为他们所做的实验都很异常。理查德·泰根。

On more than one occasion during our initial testing of the alien plasma rifles recovered from the field, we nearly suffered a catastrophic loss of the test unit while conducting simple firing runs. After a complete disassembly and analysis, it seems that the weapon operates along a very fine threshold between ideal power levels and total system failure. Even the smallest of micro fractures to any number of lightly-shielded components within the power distribution system could lead to a devastating collapse of field integrity, leaving little chance for the operator's survival. I can only assume at this point the aliens had little concern for the well-being of their own forces when designing the weapon, as I have no doubt they discovered this flaw during their own testing. In any case, I'll make the appropriate modifications to our internal designs to ensure no such weakness exists, for the safety of our troops. R. Tygan. -> 在测试外星人电浆步枪的初始阶段，有好几次都因操作不当走火而承受了毁灭性的损失。彻底拆卸并分析后，发现操作武器时细微阈值的改变就能把正常攻击状态变成彻底系统故障。动力分配系统中任何一个部件哪怕是最细小的裂缝都有可能使整个战场在顷刻间变成废墟，操作者也几乎没有生还的可能。我只能推测， 外星人在设计这款武器的时候根本就不管自己人的死活，因为他们在测试阶段肯定发现了这个缺陷。不管怎样，在研发我们自己的武器的时候，我会确保不存在这样的缺陷，以保证士兵的安全。理查德·泰根。

Our readings indicate that ADVENT just powered up some kind of Psionic transmitter in this area, and if they're assuming no one knows about it yet, it shouldn't be that well-guarded.

Over the course of a mission, the trials of battle will drain Soldier Will.

Rest soldiers on the Avenger to recover their Will when possible because entering a mission with low Will can have additional negative effects. -> 任务中，战斗的考验会削弱士兵的意志力。低意志力的士兵对灵能和残废攻击的防御力会下降，且在战斗结束后患上负面特质的几率上升。可以的话应该多让士兵在复仇者号上休息，恢复其意志力，派遣一名低意志力士兵进入战斗会有许多负面的效果。

Physically larger and more tactically capable than the subordinate troopers, the ADVENT Officers administer a system of control over the Troopers through a carefully engineered Psionic link augmented with a mechanical implant. From my initial examination of the Commander and a careful review of the information gathered in the Alien containment area, I now have a theory as to how this system was established.\n\nIt is my firm belief that this process of Psionic control was specifically engineered to allow rapid deployment of tactical information drawn directly from the subconscious mind - in this case, the mind of our very own Commander. With this hierarchy in place, tactical knowledge stored in the depths of the Commander's mind was processed and transmitted to the ADVENT Officer's, who in turn directed the Troopers and other subordinates. With the Commander no longer attached to their Psionic network, it's difficult to say how the orders are being dispersed at this point - although I'm sure the aliens have planned for this potential contingency.\n\nI believe it may be possible to tap into this \"Network,\" but it would require the use of a living ADVENT Officer to function as our conduit. To facilitate this difficult task, we've worked to develop a new device, the \"Skulljack,\" which should be capable of disabling an Officer. From there, it's simply a matter of hacking the Officer in the field - although I won't speculate as to the outcome. R. Tygan. -> 变种人军官与他们的下属相比，体型更大也更有谋略。他们通过一个精心设计的带有机械植入物做增强的灵能连接来达到系统控制军队的目的。从我对指挥官的初步检查以及对外星人隔离区收集来的数据仔细分析来看，关于这个系统是如何建立的我想已经有了头绪。\n\n我坚信，这个灵能控制过程设计出来主要是为了快速应用从潜意识中直接提取出来的战略信息。也就是说，是指挥官的思想。由于现存的等级关系，指挥官头脑深处储存的战略只是被加工并传输给了变种人军官们，由他们来轮流指挥军队和其他部下。现在指挥官不再连接在他们的灵能网络上了，很难说他们的命令是如何传达出去的，当然我确定外星人们对这种潜在的偶然性早有准备。\n\n我认为进入到这个\"网络\"是可能的，但这样就得用一个活着的变种人军官作为我们的导管。为了更进一步完成这个困难的任务，我们已经研发了一种新的装置，\"头颅接入器\"，用它我们可以使一个军官晕厥。这样的话，只要侵入到战场上的军官就可以了，当然结果我没法打包票。理查德·泰根

Preliminary autopsy exam conducted by Dr. Richard Tygan, acting science officer. Although my direct surgical experience is limited, the aliens' genetic manipulation of the species previously catalogued as a Sectoid provides a certain familiarity in relation to human anatomy. While the earliest documented accounts of Sectoids on earth indicated examples no larger than one meter in height, the specimens we encounter today are all nearly twice that size. Knowing full well that the aliens continue their efforts to integrate human and alien DNA, my findings here only reinforce the notion of a continuous development process. This larger Sectoid variant has an even greater proportion of human genetic material, selectively combined with the intention of improving the otherwise limited physical capabilities of the original. With enhanced Psionic capabilities and greater overall strength, I'd say they've succeeded. R. Tygan. -> 理查德·泰根博士作为科学主任进行了初步解剖检查。虽然我直接的手术经验有限，但外星人之前对划入灰人这一类物种的基因操作使其和人类的身体构造有着很高的相似度。最早在书面上有记录的地球上灰人例子中，他们的身高不会超过一米，但我们如今碰到的样本几乎全部都有过去的两倍大。我们很清楚外星人仍然持续在人类和外星人DNA的融合上投入精力，我的发现更加佐证了这一持续发展的过程。这个更大的灰人变种甚至有着更高比例的人类基因材料，以选择性地提升其有限的体能。拥有了增强的灵能和更强的整体力量，我得说他们成功了。理查德·泰根。

Reaper faction leader Volikov \"Volk,\" Konstantin. born est. 1990, Alaska, United States. Speaking for the human survivalist Faction of the Resistance known as the Reapers, Volk is a descendent of Russian refugees who fled to Alaska during purported exploratory incursions by the aliens prior to the onset of the invasion. Exact dates are unclear, but initial contact between Volk and Central Officer Bradford occurred during intense fighting inside the United States before the surrender of Earth's governments. Volk is known to have reacted with contempt to word of the ceasefire, gathering like-minded followers and retreating into the outlying territories far from the reach of ADVENT. In the time since, Volk and his people have come to be known as the Reapers with a fearsome reputation for survival by whatever means necessary. -> 死神派系领袖沃里科夫·康斯坦丁，通称\"沃尔克\"，出生时间为1990年左右，出生地为美国的阿拉斯加州。沃尔克领导的这支名为死神的反抗军派系是一群人类生存主义者，他本人是在外星人试探侦查及初期入侵期间逃至阿拉斯加州的俄罗斯难民后裔。虽然具体时间并不清楚，但沃尔克和军事中心长官布拉德福德是在地球政府投降前的美国内战期间相遇的。当时的沃尔克对停火宣言做出了激烈反应，这点广为人知，这之后他集结了一群拥有相同看法的追随者撤退到了变种人管辖范围外的地区。自那以后，沃尔克和他的部下就被称为死神，为了生存不择手段，令人生畏。

Neutralize their security forces, lock down the area, and seize control of the assets. -> 沈在追踪一个偶然出现在此区域的变种人微弱讯号。就我们所知，应该是一个出故障了的数据库，其中包含有外星人最新行动相关的关键数据。我们决不能错失任何拖延他们计划的机会，所以这次我们得赶去他们的列车。消灭他们的安全卫队，确保该区域安全并控制数据。

Skirmisher faction leader \"Betos,\" approximate year of activation 2020. Betos is a battle-tested warrior, the first of her kind to be freed from ADVENT. An abnormality in her control chip led to a degradation in the signals she received from the ADVENT network, eventually leaving her isolated from what had been a constant stream of commands since birth. Betos was to be executed per the Elders' command, but escaped the pursuits of their Chosen Assassin who was tasked with neutralizing these \"anomalies.\" Left with only her past experiences in combat to guide her, Betos became the protector of her kind, gathering these detached ADVENT soldiers into the group that came to be known as the Skirmishers. As their strength in numbers grew, Betos fixed her kind on a singular purpose, to destroy their creators and prevent any other worlds from suffering the same fate as Earth. -> 散兵派系领袖\"贝托斯\"，估测激活时间为2020年。贝托斯是个身经百战的士兵，第一批脱离变种人控制的混血士兵。她的控制芯片的故障降低了她接收到变种人网络信号的强度，最终导致她在出生后就脱离变种人的指挥体系而独立存在。长老下令处决贝托斯，还派出了天选者刺客来对付散兵这些\"异常现象\"，但她侥幸逃生。失去了身份的贝托斯只能凭她过去战斗获得的经验守护自己的同胞，接纳那些摆脱控制的变种人士兵，渐渐建立了现在这个名为散兵的派系。而随着散兵数量的增长，贝托斯也确立了他们存在的目标-消灭他们的创造者，防止其他世界遭受与地球一样的命运。

Templar faction leader \"Geist,\" born approx. 1995, location unknown. Although it has never been confirmed by Geist, his widely rumored origins as the Templar leader are said to begin with XCOM itself. A fresh-faced XCOM recruit activated in the earliest days of the invasion, Geist was one of the first Psionically-gifted XCOM soldiers located by Dr. Vahlen. Unfortunately, he was only in the initial stages of his training when the invasion took a turn for the worse. Though he miraculously survived, Geist was in the midst of a delicate procedure as the attack began.  Left alone and suffering from amnesia, his Psionic abilities helped him survive in the lands surrounding the ruins of the XCOM base. It is believed that Geist may have taken his name from the project codeword assigned by Vahlen to the Psi-Ops training initiative run by XCOM. -> 圣殿骑士派系领袖\"盖斯特\"，出生时间为1995年前后，出生地未知。虽然盖斯特本人从未承认过，但这位圣殿骑士领袖流传最广的出身其实正是XCOM的特工。他是在外星人入侵早期开始活动的XCOM新人，也是第一批被瓦伦博士发现的拥有灵能天赋的XCOM士兵。不幸的是，在他训练的初期，战争的局面就恶化了。虽然盖斯特奇迹般地生还了，但他在设施受到袭击时正在接受一项非常精细的手术。他孤身一人在失忆的情况下凭借灵能之力在XCOM基地的遗迹附近幸存来下来。据说盖斯特这个名字也取自瓦伦的XCOM灵能特工训练项目所指定的项目代号。

Thank you, Commander. I will let you know when this research has been completed. -> 谢谢您，指挥官。这个研究完成时我会向您报告。
Thanks to our friends in the Resistance, we have a fix on the soldier that was taken captive during our previous operation. It sounds like they're being held in a high-security ADVENT facility, and our best chance at reaching them will be to go in as quietly as possible. If we're discovered, things are going to get ugly real fast. -> 多亏了我们的反抗军朋友，我们找到了上次行动中被俘虏的士兵。他似乎被关押在某个安全等级很高的变种人设施内，营救他的最好办法就是悄悄地进去。如果我们惊动安保队，那就会热闹了。

That is definitely not fine,  Doctor. -> 那看起来一点也不好，博士。
That is definitely not fine, Doctor. -> 看起来一点也不好，博士。
That is, if it survived the crash. And if I manage to get a clear scan of it without us all being captured, or turned into Muton chow. Is it strange that I'm starting to feel excited about all this? Then again, I am covered in synthetic coolant. -> 前提是那些部件没在坠落过程中坏掉就是了。而且我们还得赶在外星人之前把它弄到手，更别提在过程中不能被异变者逮到了。说来也怪，我竟然对这个任务感到了一丝兴奋...然后现实就再一次地给我浇了一盆合成冷却液。
That it would take a machine for you to truly understand the Elders' ways, shows the depths of your inexperience. -> 你需要用机器才能理解长老的思想并证明你们多么无知。
That looked like it hurt. -> 好痛的样子。
That looks like a lot like the suit we pulled off the Commander. -> 那看起来和我们从指挥官身上扒下来的套甲像极了。
That looks more like a refinery to me, doctor. -> 博士，我觉得那看上去更像一个提炼厂。
That looks painful. -> 看起来挺疼的样子。
That must end. Even as I speak to you today, ADVENT peacekeepers are advancing into the outlying territories.... -> 这必须结束。就在我演讲的同时，变种人维和者正向那些边境之地进发...
That must end. Which is why...even as I speak to you today, ADVENT peacekeepers are advancing into the outlying territories to end this scourge once and for all.

That one doesn't seem to be in as bad of shape as the others, looks plenty fast to me-watch your range. -> 这家伙好像不像其他几个那样虚弱，我看他行动非常迅速--注意武器射程。
That opening...it appears to be a Psionic "rift" of some kind. Is it possible the aliens are using it to transmit their data beyond their facilities on Earth?" -> 那道裂隙...它看似灵能的某种\"裂痕\"。外星人是否有可能利用它来传输他们的数据而非他们地球上使用的设施？
That plant life is highly unusual - but we've seen no previous evidence of any terraforming efforts by the aliens. Perhaps it was not their intention for it to spread. -> 那种植物的生命力非同一般--但我们还未发现任何由外星人改造的证据。也许他们也不是想要它蔓延的。
That research will keep Tygan busy for a while. In the meantime, you might want to head down to the Armory. -> 这研究会让泰根忙一阵子了。在这期间，你或许会想去一下军械库。

That thing is a lot faster than the others. Watch yourselves down there, it could actually catch up with you if you're not careful. -> 这家伙比其他几个要快得多，你们小心点，不注意的话可能真会被他们抓到。
That transmitter is history, good work Commander. -> 信号发射器已摧毁，干得好，指挥官。
That turret is tracking differently than the others we've seen, they probably upgraded its sensors. I'd keep a low profile, it may come after multiple targets now if the system is responsive enough. -> 那个炮塔用的跟踪方法和其他我们看到的不同。他们大概升级了它的感应器。我不想引它注目，因为它的系统如果反应够快的话就可以同时对付几个目标。
That was a difficult loss, Commander. We need to find a way to take our fight directly to the Chosen. -> 我们输得很惨，指挥官。我们得想办法主动突袭天选者。
That was a nice trick Templar! -> 还不赖，圣殿骑士！
That was different. The stasis suit... -> 那不一样。静滞护甲...
That was fast...nice work. -> 真是迅速...干得好。
That was the least likely outcome. -> 这本应该是最不可能发生的情况。
That we can arrange Doctor. -> 这事我们可以搞定，博士。

That's a nice trick, but I've seen it before. -> 挺酷炫的，可惜我在别处见识过了。
That's a start. -> 这是一个开始。
That's alright, I'm sure I'll get another chance soon enough. -> 没关系，机会很快就会再次到来的。
That's alright, I've got other plans for you anyway. -> 没事，反正我有准备其他计划。
That's an enormous amount of data. -> 那...可是非常庞大的数据。
That's no ordinary gene therapy clinic. -> 这地方绝对不是普通的基因诊疗所。
That's not all it's doing! I'm losing the data we've already decrypted. -> 不光是这个。我之前破译的数据也不见了。
That's not all its doing. I'm losing the data we've already decrypted. -> 不光是这个。我之前破译的数据也不见了。
That's not the same rift the Codex used when it appeared. This thing could lead anywhere, it may not even be pointing at Earth. -> 那和原典出现时的裂痕不一样，它有可能通向任何地方，甚至可能并不指向地球。
That's one down, but we've still got hostiles threatening the ship. -> 一个敌人已被消灭，但依然有威胁我们的敌人。
That's one less Avatar, and one less Elder. Keep it up. -> 又少了一个化身和一长老。继续加油。
That's one of our Resistance contacts. -> 确实是反抗军联络人之一。
That's one of the ADVENT supply crates we're after, move in and place the transponders so Firebrand can pinpoint the locations for extraction. -> 那就是我们的目标之一了，去把发信器黏在上面，好让红恶魔定位并回收。

That's one of the contacts we were looking for, but there are still others in the area. -> 他是我们要找的联络人之一，但我们还需要在这里找到其他联络人。
That's one of their transmitters. They didn't put a whole lot of effort into disguising the alien tech involved. -> 那是他们的一个信号发射器。外星人并没有花太多的精力来伪装自己的科技。

That's the last of the supply crates in this area. Menace 1-5, you're clear for EVAC. We got what we came for, so don't take any unnecessary chances out there. -> 这是该区域内的最后一个补给箱了。威胁者1-5，你可以撤离了，既然我们已经完成了任务目标，那还是不要在此多加逗留为妙。
That's the thing that pulled a disappearing act when we shot down our first UFO.  And let me guess, you want to poke around in its head, too. -> 那就是在我们击落第一艘幽浮时消失不见的东西，让我猜猜看，你应该也想在它的脑海里到处闲逛一下吧。
That's... an enormous amount of data. -> 那...可是非常庞大的数据。
That's...that's impossible. -> 那...那不可能。
The "Elders" appear to be afflicted with an aggressive form of tissue degeneration. Rapid muscular atrophy to a degree I had not even thought possible. -> \"长老\"们似乎遭受了一种严重的组织退化，他们肌萎缩的快速程度让人难以置信。
The 'atmosphere' that the Andromedon alien had within its suit is leaking. Apparently, they breath something that becomes intensely acidic when mixed with oxygen... -> 仙女座外星人护甲中的'气体'在渗漏。很明显，他们呼吸的东西一接触到氧气就会变成强酸…

ADVENT peacekeepers have already moved to arrest those responsible. -> 变种人管理层再次提醒大家，XCOM最近一次针对变种人平民工人采取的暗杀行动不值得引起大家的恐慌。变种人维和部队已经着手逮捕犯人了。

The ADVENT Captain seems to provide a means of stabilizing the link between the local subordinates and the ADVENT network tower itself. -> 变种人的长官似乎在提供着一种稳定连接的方法，这种连接将当地的下属和变种人的网络塔联系起来。
The ADVENT Captain would serve our purposes nicely, if it can be disabled. -> 如果能将那个变种人队长瘫痪了的话，那会对我们很有帮助。
The ADVENT Forge must have been a shock for you, Commander. The Elders really have outdone themselves this time. -> 变种人锻造厂肯定让你吃了一惊吧，指挥官。长老这次可是超水平发挥了。
The ADVENT Forge operates at the Elders behest. It is sacred ground, and you have sullied their holy sanctuary. -> 变种人锻造厂是为长老服务的。它是属于他们的圣地，而你玷污了这块圣地。
The ADVENT General is getting close to their EVAC point, don't let 'em get away! -> 变种人将军正在接近撤离点，别让他溜了！
The ADVENT Network Tower is the central hub of the alien Psionic network and their worldwide communications system. Although the tower itself is a readily identifiable fixture to those people living in the city centers, its overall function and the extent of its capabilities are still generally unknown. It is widely believed that the ADVENT Peacekeeping forces are coordinated from somewhere within the tower. -> 变种人网络塔是外星人的灵能网络和全球通讯系统的中枢。虽然对于住在城市中央的人来说，很容易看到网络塔的所在，但它的总体功能以及作用范围尚不清楚。很多人认为变种人维和部队正是通过网络塔内部进行协调行动的。
The ADVENT Officers appear to be similar, if not physically the same, as the common ADVENT Trooper in terms of power and agility. However, field reports indicate a more developed mental acuity, as the Officers do provide tactical directives to the subordinate ADVENT forces. -> 变种人军官看起来和一般的变种人士兵很相似，就算体征不同，力量和敏捷度也差不多。然而，现场报告指出变种人军官智商更高，因为他们会对下属的变种人军队进行战术指挥。
The ADVENT Officers have clearly been modified to allow for their subordinates to receive new orders Psionically. The implanted chip is the key. -> 变种人军官很明显地被改进成可以让他们的下属通过灵能接受任务。被植入的芯片就是关键所在。
The ADVENT Purifier wields a devastating flamethrower as its primary weapon. The Purifier also carries an Incendiary Grenade to spread flames at greater range. -> 变种人净化者的主要武器是一把杀伤力惊人的火焰喷射器，他们还携带了能够在更远距离散播火焰的火焰榴弹。
The ADVENT Shieldbearers are among the most heavily armored of the conventional alien forces. Once we've pulled the suit apart, I'm sure the engineering team will find some means of integrating these improvements into our own armor designs. -> 变种人持盾者是传统外星部队中装甲最为厚重的兵种。一旦我们能够分解其护甲，我确定工程部能够找到将其整合入我们自己的护甲设计中去的方法。
The ADVENT Stun Lancer is commonly seen maintaining order and quelling disturbances throughout the world. Their unique stun lance could be adapted into a weapon our Rangers are already training to use. -> 变种人强袭枪兵在世界各地常被用来维持秩序和平定骚乱。他们特有的眩晕长枪，我们可以将其应用到我们给游侠训练的武器中。
The ADVENT Stun Lancer was apparently outfitted with the intention of serving as a civilian peacekeeping unit within the city centers. Although they are equipped with weapons capable of administering non-lethal blows, recent reports indicate an increasingly aggressive stance taken by these units. -> 变种人强袭枪兵的装备显然是用于在市中心的维和行动。尽管他们配有非致命的武器，近期的报告显示这些单位的态度也越来越激进了。

The administration is committed to ensuring a safe and secure world for everyone. -> 变种人管理层再次向大家保证，XCOM叛乱分子最近对维和部队发起的残忍突袭并不能阻止我们规范外部环境的决心。管理层致力于为所有人创造一个更为安全的世界。

By studying the underlying alien technology, our research could lead to vast improvements to own our equipment. -> 我们目前回收到的变种人尸体被一种迷人的材料混合物防护着。有一些看起来非常普通。通过学习潜在的外星人科技，我们的武器研究将会取得重大的突破。
The ADVENT cities are no place for the Reapers or our allies, so we set up safe houses set up in the tunnels underground. It sounds like the aliens followed one of our contacts down there, and I need you to mount a rescue. I have an operative in position to lead the way, but the rest is up to you. -> 变种人的城市对于死神和我们的盟友来说就是一个死亡陷阱，但有时候我们会在那里劝诱到新的联络人，因此我们在那里的地下隧道内设置了一些安全屋。遗憾的是这次外星人一路追杀联络人到了那里，所以我需要你组织一次救援行动。我已经派出一名特工为你带路了，但剩下的可就要看你们的了。
The ADVENT data shows signs of decay. Removing the Commander from their network has likely caused significant damage. -> 变种人数据显示出衰落的讯号。将指挥官从他们的网络中去移除看上去造成了极大的伤害。
The ADVENT datapad is a basic field unit designed for storing and transferring intelligence that the aliens seem otherwise incapable of disseminating through their various communications networks. Although some effort was required to interpret the alien file system and decrypt their data, it seems as though ADVENT purposely kept the device's overall function relatively simple. The evidence is little more than circumstantial, but the design of these systems could be some indication of the lower-ranking ADVENT troops' overall mental acuity outside of designated tactical scenarios. R. Tygan. -> 变种人数据存储装置是一个基础战场单位，被设计成用来储存和传输情报，看上去如果没有这种装置外星人就不能够在他们多样化的通讯网络中传播信息。尽管需要花些努力去翻译外星人档案系统和破解他们的数据，但似乎变种人有意把该装置的整体功能弄得相当简单。证据虽然不够直接，但是这些系统的设计可能表明低阶变种人军队的整体精神敏度已经处于指定的战术方案之外。理查德·泰根。
The ADVENT officers seem more capable than the grunts. We're not sure whether to chalk it up to training, or stricter mind control. -> 变种人军官看起来要比普通步兵能干些。搞不明白这到底要归结于训练成果，还是更严格的心灵控制。
The ADVENT power cells are at maximum charge, Commander. Their cannon is primed and ready to fire. -> 变种人的加农炮充能完毕了，指挥官。它们已经准备好开火了。
The ADVENT propaganda machine is running full steam; we're picking up their transmissions even way out in the middle of nowhere. -> 变种人的宣传机器正全速运转，我们甚至会在不知名的偏远地区收到他们的讯息。
The ADVENT squad was grabbing senior resistance targets for interrogation, and Shen had the misfortune of being one of the first. Or so we thought. -> 他们俘虏了不少反抗军，准备审问他们，而倒霉的沈就是其中之一。至少我们是这么认为的。
The ADVENT troopers at the facility we discovered, including the specimen before you, were Manufactured. -> 我们在设施里发现的变种人士兵，包括在你面前的这个样本，都是被制造出来的。
The ADVENT troopers at the facility we discovered, including the specimen before you, were manufactured. -> 我们在设施里发现的变种人士兵，包括在你面前的这个样本，都是被制造出来的。
The ADVENT turrets rely on the aliens' advanced automation technology, providing security emplacements to bolster their \"peacekeeping\" forces. Once we've gotten a look at the inner workings, we may be able to integrate the technology to improve our chances of defending against UFO attacks. -> 变种人炮塔依靠的是外星人先进的自动化技术，为他们的\"维和\"部队提供支援。一旦我们能够查看其内部构造，我们也许可以整合其中的技术来提升我们防御幽浮攻击的能力。
The AO is too hot for a full squad, Commander, we need to get the job done but we can only send two soldiers into the field. We'll have to do the best we can with what we've got. -> 任务区太过危险，我们不能派一整支小队前去，指挥官，所以我们只能派两名士兵前去执行任务，只能看情况随机应变了。

The Advanced Speed sim provides a slightly greater increase to the movement range of the affected soldier. -> 高级速度芯片可以较大程度地提升受影响士兵的移动范围。
The Aliens Will Know Fear! -> 外星人将会害怕我们！
The Aliens are on high alert, making it harder for XCOM to catch them unaware. -> 外星人已经提高警觉，XCOM要抓获他们更难了。
The Aliens find a mole within the Resistance, reducing the Retaliation counter by <XGParam:StrValue0/!Quantity/>. -> 外星人在反抗军中找到了一名间谍，报复行动倒计时减少<XGParam:StrValue0/!Quantity/>。

The Avenger serves our purposes adequately in terms of coordinating our communications network, but if we hope to increase our range and reach every possible outlet, we will have to do more. A series of carefully positioned relay towers would suffice, asuming we can miniaturize the technology we've adapted from the aliens' own communications equipment. It may be difficult to balance the requisite power levels versus the increased chances of detection, but this is our best chance to expand on our capabilities. With the increased coverage, we can expect the efficiency of local Resistance operations to improve, strengthening the groups working within range of the towers. R. Tygan. -> 复仇者号对协调我们的通讯网络帮助很大，但如果想扩大我们的范围并达到任何可能的地方，我们需要做更多的事情。假设我们能够把我们从外星人通讯装备上学来的技术微型化，那么一些危险位置的中继器塔就能起作用。平衡能量等级和不断增加的侦查将不是一件易事，但这是我们扩大范围的最好机会了。随着覆盖范围不断扩大，我们可以期待地方反抗军行动在效率上的提升，在中继塔的范围内加强这些团队的作战力量。理查德·泰根。
The Avenger's facilities are drawing almost as much power as we can generate. We have some capacity left, but consider building Power Relays to generate additional power soon. -> 复仇者号上的设施几乎用掉了所有我们能生成的动力了。我们可以再多建造一些设施，但先得考虑升级电力中继器以尽快生成更多的动力。

The Chosen got the upper hand on us this time, but we're not out of the fight yet. -> 天选者这次赢过我们了，但我们还不至于就此放弃。

The Chosen we have come to know as the Hunter, based on its history with the Reaper faction, seems to be the most indifferent, if not outwardly wistful, of the Chosen.

But unlike the majority of the Elders' creations, this Hunter makes no effort to hide the disdain he holds for his masters. -> 被我们称为猎手的这个天选者，基于其和死神派系之间的恩怨，我推断他是天选者中最冷漠，但也是有着最大渴望的，他究竟想要什么我也没法做出定论。但与其他被长老创造出来的天选者不同，猎手从不掩饰他对长老的蔑视之情。
The Chosen were created by the Elders as a means of countering the growing threat presented by a number of diverse, isolated factions working towards a growing human Resistance movement. Each of the Chosen represents a different approach to countering these threats, reflecting the traits of those they were sent to destroy. It is not clear how long the Chosen have been on Earth but all indications are that they have been quietly engaging smaller cells of the Resistance for some time. They also seem to operate with near autonomy from the Elders themselves with varying degrees of reverence for their creators. In combat, their power is generally unmatched by the other forces of the invasion, and the Chosen have an almost uncanny awareness of human nature beyond even the Elders understanding. -> 天选者是被长老们创造来反击人类抵抗运动中萌生的多支颇具威胁力的派系的手段。每个天选者都拥有独有的反制能力，分别代表其奉命摧毁的具体派系。尽管目前我们尚不清楚天选者已经在地球上活动了多久。但一切现象都表明他们已经和小规模的反抗军战斗了有一段时间了。他们似乎还拥有长老直接下达的一定自治权，三个天选者对长老的敬仰程度也不尽相同。其他侵略者的战斗力完全无法和他们相提并论，而且他们对人性熟悉到了可怕的程度，这点连长老都比不上他们。
The Chosen will continue to grow more powerful over time, gaining new tactical strengths in addition to powerful new strategic abilities. -> 天选者会随着时间的流逝而越来越强，获得新的战术强项和新的强力战略能力。
The Chosen's gearing up for one last showdown today. Let's punch through these things and take it down. -> 那个天选者正在为他的最后一战做准备呢。让我们击穿他的护甲，一劳永逸地做掉他。

They can also burrow underground and wait in ambush for enemy units. -> 寄生兽是一种非常恐怖的外星作战单位。尽管只能在近距离范围内攻击敌人，却可在击杀对方后利用尸体制造寄生兽茧。孵化更多的寄生兽加入战斗，此外，寄生兽还可潜伏在地下进行伏击。

The Codex is immune to fire, poison, and acid. -> 原典免疫火炎，毒素和腐蚀。
The Codex is vulnerable to anti-tech attacks. -> 原典无法抵抗反科技的攻击。
The Codex itself is a remarkable entity, far beyond our expectations of what a sentient, biological organism could or should be. Our limited exposure to it leaves a number of open questions, and as it appears to phase or flux out of our visible spectrum, it will undoubtedly prove to be a difficult specimen to study. In any case, our troops were able to recover what can only be described as the Codex \"Brain,\" a central processing unit encompassing data storage, communications, tactical control, as well as a host of other functions we've yet to identify.\n\nWith the Shadow Chamber in place, Shen and I conducted a thorough, albeit difficult series of experiments to unravel the mysteries of the device. Through a series of high-frequency exposures, we were successful in forcing the Codex to reveal itself, beyond the confines of the Brain alone. Shen expressed varying concerns about the well-being of the Codex, as it appeared to be responding, and even resisting, our efforts to decrypt the data and access the ADVENT network. I assured her any indication of pain or active intolerance of our testing was merely a byproduct of the procedure. Before the Codex destroyed itself, along with our containment area, we did manage to recover a subset of the data containing what appears to be a set of map coordinates. It will take more time to work through the remaining fragments, but in the interim we have a lead to pursue. R. Tygan. -> 原典是一种非凡的个体，远远超过了我们在科学和生物机体上的预期。我们与它有限的接触给我们留下了许多问题，随着它们渐渐消失在我们视野，要想研究它就更难了。但是不管怎样，我们的部队最后还是获得了看起来像是原典的\"脑\"的东西，一个负责整理数据存储，交流通讯，战略管理的中央处理器。其它的一些功能还尚未确认。\n\n有了暗影舱，我和沈进行了一系列完整又困难的实验，要解开这个装置的秘密。与它大量接触后，我们终于逼迫原典脑现出原形，看到它除了脑的其它部分。沈表示对原典脑的健康状况很担心，因为它在我们译码数据并侵入变种人网络时有做出反应，甚至反抗。我对她保证说测试结果带来的疼痛或无法容忍的反应都是必经步骤的附属品。在原典自爆前我们设法回收了一部分信息，初看下来是一串坐标。要恢复剩下的数据还需要一点时间，但至少我们开了个好头。理查德·泰根。
The Codex leaves only this small, nearly featureless \"brain\" when it expires, which has proven remarkably resistant to biological or mechanical scans of any kind. -> 这个又小又普通的\"脑\"就是原典消失后留下的唯一的东西，且无法用生物或机械仪器进行任何形式的扫描。

The Elders bolster me with reinforcements. -> 长老派了增援来支持我。

The Elders' Chosen Warlock, perhaps their most powerful Psionic command unit, fielded a number of potent abilities to gain physical control over those he was sent to pursue. However, as with most who find themselves in the throes of battle, when all else failed, the Warlock would return to the conventional and strike with this relatively nondescript rifle.\n\nDespite an increase in size owing to the Chosen's physical stature, the weapon itself is deceptively light in weight and delicate in balance. Although it would appear to fire the standard ADVENT round, there is an unexplained variance in effective range that I can so far only attribute to an unknown material lining the weapon's barrel.\n\nAlthough it is unlikely we would be able to accurately replicate the weapon in its entirety, I have authorized continued field trials to the indulgence of our troops. Even if the results yield no further research benefit, they will no doubt enjoy turning this weapon against the aliens who crafted it. -R. Tygan. -> 长老的天选者术士，或许正是他们部下中拥有最强灵能的指挥官。他拥有多种灵能力，能够随心所欲地操纵自己的目标。不过，跟其他陷入绝境的人一样，如果术士被逼得别无选择，他也会掏出这把相对较为平凡的传统步枪进行殊死一搏。 \n\n虽然这把步枪的体积根据天选者较大的体型做了一定的调整，但它实际上却惊人地轻便平衡。尽管它发射的似乎是标准的变种人子弹，但它的有效射程却超越了制式步枪，目前来看这应该归功于它的枪管所使用的特殊材料。\n\n虽然完全复制这把武器不太现实，但我已经批准让我们的部队继续使用它进行实战检验。就算测试成果不理想，他们肯定也会享受这种以彼之道还施彼身的感觉。-理查德·泰根

The alien data cache appears to be a physical storage device intended for direct interface with the datapads we've seen the ADVENT forces carrying in the field. Having successfully decrypted the files, including a variety of tactical data and varying intelligence, I've yet to discover what it is about this data in particular that requires the aliens to maintain physical stores of critical information. Considering the sophistication of their technology in general, one would think the inherent security risks involved would be enough to dissuade them. In any case, it can only benefit us to seize these assets whenever possible. R. Tygan. -> 外星人数据缓存看上去是一个物理储存装置，它能够同我们在战场上看到变种人携带的那种数据存储装置进行交互。在成功破解这些文件，包括大量的战术数据和不同的情报之后，我并未发现为何外星人需要对重要信息进行物理上的储存。考虑到外星人技术一般都很复杂，你可能会觉得内在包含的安全风险就已经足以阻止他们使用此项技术了。无论如何，不管什么时候有机会拿到这些东西对我们都只会有所帮助。理查德·泰根。

The aliens have a secure facility hidden in this area conducting research crucial to the Avatar project, and we've got enough information at this point to move in and take it out.

We should have known they never left. -> 外星人一直是怪物。最开始的时候，只是一次又一次的失败实验。甚至出现了变种人军队，他们还想继续掩盖，但他们在护甲下毫无差别。到了现在，外星人弄出了一个设施，不仅要把我们消灭，还想要把我们转化成不知道什么鬼东西。我们早该知道长老们会回来的，早该知道他们从未离开过。

The aliens may have cleaned up the design, but these monsters are no better off than the ones my father dealt with. -> 外星人可能是简化了整体的设计，但这些怪物们和我爸爸对付的那些相比没有好到哪里去。

Move to lock down the area and eliminate any security forces nearby. -> 我们必须要告诉外星人，我们是认真的。我们正准备潜入市中心攻击他们的要害。为了达到这个目的，我们准备摧毁一个高价值目标。这个目标的倒下会引起公众的注意，尤其是变种人。控制该区域，并消灭附近的警卫力量。

The aliens used this to defeat most of Earth's heavy conventional forces. It can punch through armor just as easily as it chews through infantry. Be careful. -> 外星人曾使用它击溃过绝大多数的地球重装备常规军。它能够像嚼碎步兵那样轻而易举地击穿护甲。还是小心为妙。
The aliens will always tell you otherwise, but this is the true voice of the Resistance, bringing you the real news about the latest victory over the invaders. We're getting stronger every day, and XCOM is making that happen. -> 外星人总会告诉你相反的事实，而这里是来自反抗军的真实声音，带给你我们对抗入侵者胜利的真实新闻。我们每天都在变强，而XCOM正是使其成真的组织。

The aliens' primary shock troops are even more dangerous than they were when we faced them during the invasion. Our hope is that we can emulate their plasma-based explosives for our purposes. -> 外星人主力突袭部队比我们在上一次战争中碰到的还要危险，不过他们的电浆爆破物能被我们反向研究，或许我们能因此取胜。
The aliens, and to a lesser extent ADVENT, have long relied on the otherworldly element known as Elerium to power everything from their weapons systems to the UFOs themselves. It may take some time, but furthering our understanding of this material could greatly advance our own weapon and armor development projects. -> 外星人还有很少一部分变种人一直以来都依靠着被称为超铀的外星物质来加强他们的武器系统还有提升他们的幽浮。这也许要花一些时间，但对这一物质了解地更深入无疑会大大加快我们自身武器和护甲的发展项目。
The always talented and ever-deadly forces of XCOM once again infuriated the Elders today by making quick work of a high-ranking ADVENT field commander who made the mistake of crossing paths with our vigilant friends. According to eyewitness accounts, the ADVENT officer's last words were "GOrrrralaslk Blahhhhh" which means absolutely nothing to anyone. -> 机智而强大的XCOM小队今天再次通过果断击杀他们遇到的变种人高阶指挥官的方式羞辱了长老一把，这个军官犯下的最大错误就是撞到了我们的XCOM。根据目击者所说，它的遗言好像是\"嘎哦哦哦哇啊啊啊\"，没有任何意义可言。

The beings that inhabit these suits clearly come from an environment utterly hostile to humans. The corrosive substance they use as a weapon may be the equivalent to water for them - but on this planet it's deadly. I've theorized as to how the substance could somehow be used to our advantage as part of an explosive weapons system. -> 蜗居在这些护甲里的生物很显然来自人类无法生存的环境。他们用做武器的这种腐蚀性物质对他们来说很可能就相当于水对于我们。但在这个星球上是致命的。通过研究这件盔甲与其操作员之间的互动，我们或许可以设计出一种对付酸性物质的隔离系统，并运用到我们的战场上。

The data you see is being pulled directly from this Advent Captain's implant. This sequence, here, is essentially you, Commander. Or at least the tactical information they were processing through your mind. As you can see, the data is nearly identical. -> 你们现在看到的数据是从变种人军官的植入物中直接拉取的。这里的序列，和你的一样，指挥官。至少他们在处理的战术信息，是近乎一致的。
The day is mine, and so I will leave you to mourn. -> 我已经胜利了，你们慢慢哀悼吧。
The death of an ADVENT priest will surely anger my brother. -> 变种人祭司之死会激怒我的兄弟。
The death of one of my siblings will do nothing to deter my advance! My loyalty to the Elders is everlasting! -> 我同胞的死亡也不能阻止我前进的步伐！我对长老的忠诚是永恒的！
The death of these subordinates will prevent nothing! -> 就算杀了我这些部下也没有任何用处。
The deceitful traitors who have left the service of the Elders are known to reside nearby, you would do well to distance yourself from these feckless creatures. -> 那群背叛长老的变节者脑后可是长着反骨的，我建议你们别跟他们扯上关系，这是为你们自己好。
The dense urban sprawl of Sao Paulo left little room for escape during the chaotic fray of the alien's initial attacks. -> 圣保罗密集的城市发展格局在外星人首次攻击时留给人们的逃脱空间很少，造成了混乱局面。
The design may be a function of the network itself, the amount of Psionic energy filtered through that system is beyond measure... -> 这样设计可能是网络本身的作用之一，通过该系统过滤的灵能能量不可限量...

The device appears to be some sort of psionic capacitor transferring tremendous amounts of psionic energy directly to the Chosen. Restoring them! -> 仪器显示某种灵能电容器正在向天选者输送大量的灵能能量，治愈他的伤口！
The discovery of this subject encased in a suit similar to your own is intriguing, Commander. The loss of their facility, and this specimen, could be an even greater victory than we had imagined.  -> 他们设施的毁坏以及这些样本，意味着我们取得了想象中的胜利。
The dishonor of your defeat is only compounded by the contempt you've shown your own soldier by leaving them behind. -> 你不仅输了，还让你的手下见到了你抛弃同伴的丑恶面目，真是耻辱至极。
The distinctive alien artifact we recovered from the field resembles a portal or gateway of some kind. Although we believe it provides the aliens with a means of long-distance travel, potentially beyond the confines of our world itself, it will take time before we can truly understand the gateway's function. -> 我们从战场上找到的外星人部件很像传送门或通道之类的东西。尽管我们相信它为外星人提供一种远距旅行的方法，甚至可以到我们世界以外的地方，我们也需要一段时间才能完全了解这个通道的作用。
The distinctive creature your troops encountered was clearly of some importance to the aliens. I will leave it to your team to uncover just what that may be, Commander.  -> 你的军队遭遇的那些生物很明显对外星人来说至关重要。我希望你的军队可以找出那到底是什么，指挥官。

The enemy has overrun XCOM's headquarters. We are no longer capable of fighting the alien invasion. -> 敌人压制了XCOM总部。我们已无力反抗外星入侵。
The enemy is food. -> 敌人就是我们的食物。
The enemy is testing our capabilities, Commander.  We've gotten reports of simultaneous attacks in two different countries.  We can only respond to one. -> 指挥官，敌人正在测试我们的能力。接到报告，有两起攻击事件同时在不同国家发生。我们只能针对其中一起采取响应措施。
The enemy turrets are hammering the ship, we have to take them out before they breach our hull! -> 飞船周围探测到敌人运来了攻城用装备，我们得在它们打穿船体前摧毁这些武器！

The entire swarm knows there is "food" here now. I would advise we make haste to leave this area. -> 现在失魂者都知道这里有食物了。我建议大家立刻离开这片区域。
The existence of this artifact, which we believe to be a communication device of some kind, begs the question- If the Sectoid Commander was the alien leader, then who, or what, was it communicating with? -> 我们相信这个应该是某种通讯装置，抛开这个问题的本质--如果灰人指挥官是外星人领袖，那它是在和谁，或是和什么进行沟通？
The expedition has limited ammo reserves, if that turret runs out the Lost are going to make quick work of them. We need to reach the group before that happens. -> 考察队的弹药量有限，一旦耗尽弹药失魂者就会把他们大卸八块。我们得在那之前找到他们。
The extreme toxicity of the Chryssalid venom requires individual specimen storage in reinforced caskets, each of which have been securely padlocked upon the advice of veteran combat staff. -> 寄生兽的毒液毒性猛烈，需要储存在特别强化过的容器内，且根据某位经验丰富的战士所言，需要锁在安全的地方。
The facility of the false gods is no more, and their vision is shaken at its very foundation. -> 伪神们的设施已处理完毕，他们的计划再次被我们从根基上动摇了。
The fact that this armored environmental suit is capable of functioning in combat well after the original wearer has expired is, remarkable. I must consult with Shen for further study into this unusual behavior. -> 原始穿戴者脱下后，这些全副武装的环境套甲可以自己加入战斗，这很引人注目。我必须和沈好好研究一下这种不寻常的行为模式。
The fact that we now have access to Gauss weaponry that is both combat effective and safe to operate at these power levels is quite an achievement. The overall design relies on advanced miniaturization technologies developed by the aliens which are, frankly, well beyond anything conceived of by Earth's leading military development firms at the time of the invasion. Despite our limited capability for extended test firings on board the ship, our latest prototypes are already capable of consistently accelerating an adaptive alloy projectile to over 5000 m/s in a simulated environment. We're still preparing the final assessment, but it is likely a field deployable unit would have to be limited to a lower power threshold due to the potential for ongoing strain to our troops when operating the weapons. R. Tygan. -> 我们已经能制造出集攻击性与安全性于一体的高斯武器了，这一消息非常振奋人心。全部的设计都采用了外星人先进的微型技术。坦白说，他们的技术的确领先于地球顶级军事发展公司。虽然船内实验室限制了我们的测试条件，但我们最新的样品在模拟环境中已经具有将合金弹头持续加速到5000m/s的能力。我们仍在准备着最后的测试，由于操纵该武器时对我们部队潜在的负担，看起来这项可部署的力场单位必须限制在低能量阈值的范围内。理查德·泰根。
The false gods have found many ways to channel the Earth's power, and so shall we. -> 伪神拥有许多获得地球之力的手段，我们也应该这样。
The false gods have sent <XGParam:StrValue1/!ChosenName/> to do what they themselves cannot. If we do not slow its progress, it will no doubt come for you soon enough, Commander. We must strike first, and fast. -> 伪神派<XGParam:StrValue1/!ChosenName/>来干他们自己做不到的事了。如果我们不延缓他们的进度，恐怕他们很快就会找到你，指挥官。我们必须迅速出击，占得先机。
The fate of this world rests on the shoulders of your band of misfits. But in the end, the blame for its loss will lie with you.    -> 你们这群无能之辈肩负着这个世界的命运。然而最后，你们只会落得一败涂地的骂名。
The fear I instilled in your captive soldier was enough to make them tell me everything, Commander. -> 我在俘虏心中植入的恐惧足以使他们告诉我任何事情，指挥官。

The first invasion was a test. But your people did not fail as you believe. You succeeded beyond measure. You need only accept your place amongst us... -> 第一次入侵只是一次测试罢了。你的人民并不像你认为的那样失败。你获得了巨大的成功。你只需要加入我们...
The first reload in a mission does not cost an action. -> 任务中第一次装填弹药不消耗行动点。
The following directives have been identified by Resistance analysts based on a thorough review of ADVENT's ongoing propaganda effort. The aliens' key areas of focus as directed towards the civilian populace are: recruitment of an increasing number of civilians into the city centers; nurturing an atmosphere of distrust to encourage self-reporting among city center inhabitants; encouragement of the belief that so-called \"dissident groups\" are to blame for perceived faults; disassociation of traditional beliefs and value systems in favor of adulation for the Elders. -> 反抗军分析师对变种人进行中的宣传活动进行彻底的调查之后，识别出了下列指令。外星人针对平民的关注重点区域是：增加对市中心平民招募的数量；营造一种不信任的气氛，以鼓励市中心居民们进行自我报告；鼓励把感知错误归咎于所谓\"不同政见群体\"的观点；抛弃传统信念和道德体系，转而崇拜长老。
The forces of ADVENT have taken many captives in their time, but they are not nearly as persuasive as I am. -> 变种人过去也抓到过不少俘虏，但他们的游说能力完全比不上我。
The forces of XCOM are legendary for their prowess in battle. Their fabled Commander even more so. Today you face a warrior unlike any you have ever encountered, the one who will be your end. -> XCOM的士兵因其战斗中展现出的强大实力而被称为传说。他们那有名的指挥官更是个战术奇才。但今天你们要面对的是前所未有的强敌，它会给你们的传说划上休止符。
The forecast calles for... COLLATERAL DAMAGE. -> 接下来就是...附加的伤害。
The forgotten ones. The Lost. We cannot allow them to get close! -> 被遗忘的人。失魂者。不能让它们靠近！
The funding offered by individual council members is randomized. -> 由理事会会员个人提供的资金是随机的。
The further we got, the stronger the signal from the new self-proclaimed \"King of the airwaves.\" Part of me was almost hoping ADVENT would drown him out with some soothing propaganda of their own, but he had really jammed up their frequencies somehow. -> 我们越是往前走，那个所谓的\"电波之王\"的家伙的信号就越强。我是真的挺希望变种人为了控制言论把他干掉的，但这家伙也算是把变种人的无线频率弄得一团糟了。
The fusion cores of those pods were considered volatile by ADVENT standards even 20 years ago. Tampering with one now would be ill-advised. -> 这些舱体的聚变反应堆芯即使是以变种人20年前的标准来看都可以说极不稳定。我强烈反对摆弄它们。

The grenade in your grenade-only slot gains a bonus use. -> 在榴弹专用槽中获得一个额外榴弹。
The ground nearby was littered with shell casings and scorched from the impact of energy weapons. While examining the seemingly desolate area, a lone veteran who had come to the scene with salvage for barter approached our squad hoping to do business. It took very little convincing for them to join our ranks. -> 地面上满是弹壳和能量武器造成的焦土。检查这片区域的时候，一个老兵找到了我们，希望以物易物做点交易。我们不费吹灰之力就说服了他加入我们的队伍。
The heavily damaged remains of an small airport spread out on the horizon, the runways still littered with aircraft that never got off the ground. Our engineering team was able to extract the radio equipment from some of the aircraft and use it to enhance our communications network. -> 眼前是空军基地废墟，跑道上遍地是再也飞不起来的飞行器残骸。我们的工程部团队取出了大多数飞行器的无线电设备，用来加强我们的通讯网络。

The information I've uncovered so far outweighs the loss of the shadow chamber, as you'll see... -> 目前为止我发现的信息比暗影舱的损失更有价值，正如你所见...
The introduction of a magnetic accelerator to the original Skirmisher Bullpup rifle provides an even more lethal punch to an already dangerous close-quarters weapon. Although ADVENT may have originally supplied these soldiers with ammunition based on the alien alloys, they've had to make due with more conventional materials in the time since they were freed. -> 给散兵的原版无托式机枪加装磁能加速装置让这种本已极具威胁的近距离武器变得更为致命。不过变种人之前配给的弹药是用外星合金制成的，但现如今他们已经脱离了长老的控制，只能用传统材料制成的弹药将就了。
The introduction of a magnetic projectile accelerator into the automatic pistol wielded by the Templars would seem to be at odds with the weapon's original design. Still, as we have seen they made it work despite the lack of a proper engineering background guiding their initial experiments. Indoor trials of this weapon are currently prohibited. -> 将磁能弹丸加速装置整合进圣殿骑士所用的自动手枪初看是和其设计理念相悖的。不过，正如我们所见，尽管缺乏工程经验让开始的实验颠簸不断，他们最后还是成功了。严禁在室内试用这把武器。
The invasion. The occupation. ADVENT. A giant lab experiment. And we're the rats. -> 入侵...占领...变种人...大型的实验室试验。我们就是小白鼠。
The key '<XGParam:StrValue0/!KeyName/>' is already mapped to the <XGParam:StrValue1/!BoundActionName/> action. Rebinding this key will remove its previous functionality, would you like to continue? -> <XGParam:StrValue0/!KeyName/>'键已绑定<XGParam:StrValue1/!BoundActionName/>。重新绑定该按键会自动取消其之前的快捷功能，确定继续？

The loud explosion draws a Lost Swarm closer! -> 巨大的爆炸声吸引了一群失魂者接近！
The magnetic rifles used by ADVENT's forces are incredibly complex weapons. The rifles themselves self-destruct when their original operator dies, but with a little effort we might be able to use any recovered parts to improve our soldiers' own weapons. -> 变种人用的磁力步枪是一个非常复杂的武器。步枪在它的第一任使用者死亡后会自毁，但是稍微努力一下我们或许就可以用找到的回收部件来改进我们自己的武器。
The main entrance is clear. We need to move on the package. -> 主要通道安全，我们可以继续向目标移动。
The many large caves found in this region long contributed to rumors that the original XCOM headquarters was once found here. While exploring the area, we did find the weathered remains of both human and alien aircraft abandoned since the invasion. After a few hours underground, our team successfully returned with a number of alien materials found hidden in the caves. -> 这个区域有很多大型洞穴。有传言说这里曾经是XCOM的总部。搜查的时候，我们发现了已经风化的人类和外星人的飞行器，大概入侵时期就被遗弃在这里了。经过几个小时的搜寻，我们的团队成功回到地面，并带回了不少藏在洞穴中的外星人资料。
The map coordinate data recovered from the Codex brain led us to this: a powerful Psionic artifact embedded deep in the wilderness. The question is: if this is truly a gateway, then what lies on the other side? -> 根据从原典脑中获得的地图坐标数据，我们找到了一个埋藏在荒野深处的强大灵能遗迹。问题是：如果它真的是一个通道，那门的另一边是什么样的呢？
The map was driving us towards what looked to be some kind of freight yard, but first we had to cut across the edge of town near a local dive bar. I remember being genuinely excited at the prospect of finding a nice stiff drink. -> 地图上标出的位置看起来似乎是个货运场，但我们首先得穿过小镇边缘的桌球酒吧。我记得当时看到酒吧我还挺兴奋的 -- 以为自己总算是能喝上一杯放松放松了。
The match you are attempting to join is already full. -> 您尝试加入的游戏已满。
The material recovered from the alien Blacksite included a set of coded coordinates that led us to this facility. Remote reconnaissance indicates a heavy enemy presence at the site. Investigate the facility and find out what the connection is to the Blacksite and the aliens' ongoing operations. -> 在外星人黑地找到的材料中系列加密的坐标，带我们找到了这个设施。远距离侦查表明此地存在大量敌人。调查这个设施，找到其与黑地及外星人目前工作重心的联系。
The maximum Focus level is increased to 3. -> 最高专注等级提升至3。

The most dangerous game? Hardly. -> 你以为这就算惊险了？差远了。
The most public face of ADVENT security, the standard ADVENT Trooper serves in a first-response role in areas of high public exposure. Although rumors as to their origins have persisted for years, it's only recently that we've confirmed that they are in fact the product of a human-alien hybrid development. My initial autopsy indicates that the troopers were at one time entirely human, implying some means of gradual genetic enhancement without the rejection concerns that would normally plague these experiments. The body itself maintains the general outward appearance of a typical human, with the most crucial changes occurring in the cranial structure. It is my belief that the ADVENT troopers receive their orders, that is to say are controlled, directly through a Psionic link engineered as part of the genetic modification process. As we first discovered in the field, the eyes are notably larger, perhaps as an unintended side-effect, as they seem to provide only limited improvements to the Trooper's visual acuity. The aliens have managed to disguise this glaring physical trait from the general public through the use of cleverly designed armor. R. Tygan. -> 变种人护卫中出现最多的就是标准变种人士兵，他们在高曝光率的地区从事快速反应的工作。虽然有传闻说他们的祖先已经存在很久了，但最近我们才确定他们其实是人类和外星人的混种。初步解剖表明他们曾经是人类，这表示他们拥有一些逐渐增强基因的手段，并且不需要考虑通常会影响这类实验的排异反应。因此，士兵们的身体保持着一个典型人类的外形，但头部结构发生了重要变化。我相信变种人军队是直接通过灵能连接来接收指令，也就是受控制的，而这个连接是基因修改过程中的一部分。正如我们在第一次战场上看到的，他们的眼睛特别大，这或许就是一种始料未及的副作用，但这并没有很大的改进他们的视力。外星人则通过设计得当的护甲来掩盖掉他们明显的体征。理查德·泰根。
The mysteries of the Chosen's creation by the Elders will likely be left only to theory. As it stands now, we are still struggling to simply understand the already diverse range of schemes they employ. -> 关于长老是如何创造出天选者的，我也只能做出一定的推测。至少现在，我们仍旧难以理解他们多变的阴谋。
The mysterious ADVENT Blacksite must be investigated by an XCOM strike team, and any relevant artifacts must be recovered for study. -> 我们必须派出突击小队调查变种人黑地并回收相关物品以作研究。

The ones that keep us up at night. -> 这家伙让我们夜不能寐。
The only reaction I will accept from them, is their deaths. Find us that exit. -> 消灭他们，是我唯一能接受的东西。快找出口。
The only thing on the line here is your planet, Commander. No pressure. -> 没事，失败的话不就是赔上一个星球嘛，指挥官，不要有压力。
The only thing worse than losing the fight down here, is listening to the Elders rant about it later. -> 比打败仗更糟糕的事莫过于忍受长老的指责了。
The organism within the Gatekeeper's shell is highly unusual, seemingly reliant on the shell itself for sensory input. Long sequences of engraved symbols not unlike ancient hieroglyphs adorn the inner lining of the shell. -> 看门人外壳内的组织非常不同寻常，表面上来看它依靠着外壳本身来进行感受输入。外壳的内部雕刻着与古代象形文字相差无几的长串符号。

The outcome of this research can only further our advances, Commander. -> 本次研究结果一定会推动我们的发展，指挥官。
The overgrown husk of an old tank was left deeply embedded in the soil as if dropped from the sky. Whether this was the result of alien activity, or a failed airdrop attempt, is unknown. We were able to strip the tank of its weapon systems and repurpose them for our own use. -> 这台杂草丛生的坦克被深深地埋在土里，仿佛是从天上掉下来的一样。没有人知道知道这是外星人的杰作还是空投时发生的意外。只要我们能够把坦克上的武器都拿出来为我们所用就好了。

We can scan at this location to gain additional support from their people. -> 这里就是圣殿骑士派系的所在地。他们在灵能的使用上多少有点极端，但对反抗军还是非常忠诚的。我们可以扫描这片区域，看看他们的居民能不能为我们提供额外的支援。

As well as contacting Geist, their leader. -> 这个圣殿骑士联络员虽然有些与众不同，但目前来看一切还算正常。我们已经知道了圣殿骑士总部的位置。我们还不是很了解这些圣殿骑士，所以去那里看看应该没错。还能与他们的领袖盖斯特取得联系。

This species was quickly tagged by our forces in the field as a \"Berserker,\" based on its often irrationally aggressive behavior on the battlefield. Upon initial examination, it's difficult to ignore the extreme muscle growth present throughout the specimen, leaving little need for extensive armor or even conventional weaponry for that matter. I suspect the added bulk of the subject to be the direct result of an intentional protein deficiency engineered by the aliens explicitly to create the hulking mass we see today. As for its behavior, I can only infer that was intended as well, as the aliens are well within their capability to manipulate the endocrine glands or equivalent for the purposes of hormonal behavioral control. In any case, this is an extremely dangerous and unstable species, best avoided by our troops at anything other than long range. R. Tygan. -> 由于他们在战场上极为侵略性的行为，这些物种很快就被我们战场上的士兵称为\"狂战士\" 。我们很难忽略这些物种极为突出的肌肉生长状态，这使得他们不怎么需要强力的护甲甚至传统的武器。我怀疑大部分这些单位最初是外星人制造巨人过程中有意造成的蛋白质缺陷的直接结果。对于其行为，我只能推断这也是有意而为之的，因为操纵内分泌腺体和荷尔蒙行为性的控制完全在外星人的能力范围之内。在任何条件下，它们都是一种极度危险以及不可预测的物种，我们的部队最好避免与之正面冲突，远距离交火才比较明智。理查德·泰根。

The aliens are going to send whatever they can after us, and we should be prepared. With that in mind, I've come up with a few improvements to the core plasma rifle design that should allow us to step up the power without substantial increases to weight. With the added intensity, it might also be possible to divide the targeting field into a multi-shot projectile stream. I'm guessing the heavier variant will be best suited to the Grenadiers, they don't seem all that concerned about carrying around unstable ordnance. L. Shen. -> 泰根迫切地想要攻克我们之前早就提出来的电浆武器的极限。虽然在船内进行研究必须小心谨慎，但我依然觉得这不能成为研究工作的阻碍。外星人为了对付我们，什么东西都有可能派过来，我们必须有所准备。由此，我提出了对电浆步枪设计核心的改进意见，能使提升其攻击性而重量不会增加很多。随着强度的增加，瞄准力场将可能分割为多重射击弹道流。我猜重装改良型将非常适合榴弹兵使用，他们似乎并不在乎随身携带不稳定的军械。莉莉·沈。
Tygan insists our forces should have no trouble disabling a Codex in the field, at least long enough for us to hack into the ADVENT network. The hard part will be convincing our troops not to kill this thing as soon as it appears; no one is ever particularly excited about trying to get up close and personal when it comes to these obscure alien species, except maybe our Rangers.   -> 泰根坚持说我们的军队在战场上不怕对付原典，至少时间足够我们骇入变种人的网络。难的部分在于我们要使士兵不要太急着杀死它们。没有人能够对接近这种外星物种感到兴奋，除了我们的游侠们。

Very little information about Dr. Vahlen still exists following the destruction of XCOM's original headquarters. Central Officer Bradford is now the only living member of the staff to have had personal contact with her, and he generally remains aloof when pressed for further information. Notes and various remnants of data from the original XCOM database indicate an aggressive pursuit of alien material sought for study by Dr. Vahlen with limited concern for the potential outcomes of these new theoretical research fields. Dr. Vahlen's status following the destruction of XCOM HQ is unknown. No further contact has been established. -> 莫拉·瓦伦博士，出生日期不明，2015年3月外星人入侵开始时担任XCOM的首席科学家。由于XCOM原总部被摧毁，只有少量关于瓦伦博士的资料留存下来。指挥中心长官布拉福德是目前存活的成员当中唯一仍与她有联系的人，但如果有人向他追问瓦伦博士的情况，他一般都会避而不答。根据原XCOM数据库的记录和各种残留数据显示，瓦伦博士积极主张对获得的外星素材进行研究，很少考虑这些全新理论性研究领域带来的潜在后果。XCOM总部被摧毁之后，瓦伦博士的下落不明，无法再与她取得联系。

We have confirmation, mission accomplished. -> 确认完毕，任务完成。
We have dedicated the entirety of our efforts to discovering the purpose of the Avatar Directive, and now, it seems we're finally gaining ground on the aliens. With that said, I was shocked to see that our troops not only encountered what was apparently a fully responsive Avatar specimen, but that it engaged them in combat and was subsequently dispatched with only moderate difficulty.\n\nWith all that went in to its creation, somehow I expected that the Avatar would be a foe unlike any other, something perhaps even beyond our own capabilities to counter. Initially, it appeared as though my assumptions were wrong.\n\nHumanoid in form, the physical attributes of the Avatar specimen are, on the surface, wholly unremarkable. It has a musculature system not all that unlike a young adult human, with no obvious genetic adulterations to enhance its physical strength or agility. At this point I could only surmise that the aliens focused entirely on what lies beneath the Avatar's seemingly ordinary structure.\n\nAs I continued my analysis of the Avatar specimen, including a rapid genetic sequencing aided by the Shadow Chamber, I discovered my earlier conclusions could not be further from the truth. This Avatar, what was left of it, is still not \"whole\" in a developmental sense. Although portions of the missing genetic links have since been filled with what is undoubtedly Elder DNA, there are still gaps; incomplete sequences that leave the creature unable to fully sustain its own power. It is now my firm belief that we have yet to encounter a fully developed Avatar, and its potential capabilities at full strength leave me deeply concerned. R. Tygan. -> 我们一直以来都在致力于找出化身计划的真正目的，而现在，看起来我们终于逼近了真相。我很震惊地发现，我们的部队不仅仅是遇到了显然完全都是化身计划的变种人，而且外星人将他们部署到战场投入战斗并不怎么费力。\n\n这都要追溯到它的诞生，我之前以为化身将会是和其他物种完全不同的生物，甚至是我们无法反击的生物。最初的时候，这看起来我的猜想是错误的。\n\n形态上类人，化身种的物理属性完全不起眼。它的肌肉组织系统与年轻成年人类似，没有明显的基因调整迹象。目前我只能说外星人专注的点都掩埋在化身种极为普遍的结构之下。\n\n当我继续我对化身种的分析，包括许多由暗影舱协助的基因序列测试，我发现其实我早些时候的结论和事实差距并不大。化身，仍然还未处在\"完全\"开发的状态。虽然一些丢失的基因连接已经毫无疑问地是被长老的DNA填补了，但化身DNA依然有空白处，未完全的序列让这个生物无法得到完全的力量。我非常坚定地相信，我们还未遇到过完全开发的化身，它的潜在能力让我非常担心。理查德·泰根。
We have found one of the Elders' facilities, and now we must raze it to the ground! -> 我们找到长老的设施了，该把它炸成废墟了！

We have used shelters deep in the tunnels beneath the Elders' cities since the first of my kind were freed. An important ally has fled to the safety of one such shelter, but now the Elders' puppets are closing in. One of my kind is near to assist in your efforts, do what you can to aid our shared cause. -> 我们中第一批获得自由的人曾在长老城市下的隧道中暂避过风头。有位重要的友军目前就采取了跟我们当初同样的策略，但如今长老的傀儡正在接近。我的一名同胞也在现场支援那位友军，请尽你所能帮助他们。

We just got word from our friends in the Resistance, some of their people were pursued by ADVENT forces into an abandoned city not far from here.

We're moving in to seize that data and stop their progress before this goes any further. Eliminate any hostile contacts and secure the area. -> 我们刚从反抗军那儿获得消息，他们定位了一个本区域变种人的数据库，库中存储了外星人最新行动的重要信息。我们得马上赶往该区域获得数据并提前阻断他们的计划进程。干掉所有敌军并确保区域安全。

We know all too well of the Elders' Chosen and their endless hunt. They will come for you, come for your ship, just as they have for my kind.

But we must be prepared, it will not be an easy fight. -> 我们都清楚长老的天选者有多固执。他不找到你，不找到你的飞船绝不会善罢甘休，这就像他当初对我们一样。我们应该一起集中资源追踪<XGParam:StrValue2/!ChosenClass/>。如果我们能找到它的避难所，就能攻其不备。但我们首先得做好相应的准备，这肯定会是场硬仗。
We know how this goes. Keep a careful eye on the Chosen, they could react at any moment! -> 我们都清楚该怎么办。盯紧那个天选者，他随时都有可能行动！

Their weapons and equipment are still intact, and can be disassembled for valuable resources. -> 我们定位了一个被草草掩盖但占地巨大的大型墓穴。勉强挖掘了部分区域后，我们找到了几具已经严重受伤的灰人的尸体。他们的武器装备倒是完好无损，拆装后利用价值巨大。

Today's cruel ambush of ADVENT outreach squads again proves that we can no longer tolerate XCOM's commitment to the violence and cruelty of the old world. -> 我们决不能低估我们敌人错误信仰的根深蒂固。今天变种人外派小队受到的残酷伏击证明了我们不能再容忍XCOM这种来自旧世界的野蛮暴力行为了。

We noticed early on that the Avenger has a tendency to "dip" forward when the power core is under load without the engines engaged. At first I thought maybe it was a stabilizer issue, but now I'm starting to think it's all just part of the aliens' grand design. The core itself may not be entirely stable, which would explain why the aliens went through so much trouble to isolate it in the bow. -> 我们早就发现复仇者号在引擎不启动的低负载情况下船身会常常前倾。起初我还以为这是稳定装置的问题，但我开始意识到这会是外星人宏观设计的一部分。核心本身不是完全稳定的，这也就解释了为什么外星人要花那么大力气在船头特意将核心隔离开来。

We picked up an alien transmission, they're trying to move an ADVENT troop transport the resistance disabled during a recent skirmish. There's an opportunity here for us to pull some of their technology off the transport, but we'll need to secure the area and eliminate any remaining hostiles to make that happen. -> 我们找到了一个来自外星人的通信信号，他们正在维修一架被反抗军瘫痪的变种人军队运输工具。这是一个回收他们的科技的好机会，但是我们需要确保该地区的安全并消灭剩余敌人来使计划成功。
We picked up an emergency transponder signal from one of the Resistance Factions. Some of their people were attacked by ADVENT and forced to take refuge in one of the old abandoned cities.

We recovered the operative from ADVENT's compound, but it cost the entire team their lives. It's hard to call this a success, Commander. -> 虽然我们从变种人的设施中救出了特工，但为此搭上了整支小队。这样可算不上成功，指挥官。

We showed the Chosen that the Resistance is here to stay, Commander. Now we just have to find that thing and put it down for good.  -> 我们今天让天选者见识到了反抗军的厉害，指挥官。接下来我们只要找到他，再一劳永逸地干掉他就好了。

We stand with you, Commander. -> 我们与你同在，指挥官。

We're barely keeping up with the flood of refugees here as people continue to desert the ADVENT-controlled city centers. -> 随着人们继续逃离变种人控制的城市中心，我们勉强才跟上这里的难民潮。
We're being asked to assist in a rescue operation for a Resistance VIP currently trapped by ADVENT in the tunnels beneath the city center. I'm not sure what our target was up to, but the Resistance needs us to get 'em out of there. Hostile activity in the area is very likely, so keep your heads up. -> 反抗军请求我们协助他们的一个营救VIP的行动，那名VIP目前被变种人困在市中心下方的隧道内。我不知道目标在那里做什么，但既然反抗军需要我们的帮助，我们当然义不容辞。该区域内很有可能会出现敌军，招子都放亮点。
We're calling this heavy power armor the W.A.R. suit. This is as tough and strong as we can make 'em, with plenty of power for handling heavy weapons. -> 我们把这个重型装甲称为W.A.R.护甲。我们让它们尽可能的结实和强力，它有强大的动力，可以使用多种重武器。

This is a risky operation, but if we pull this off there won't be any place left for that thing to hide. I'm only trusting my best people on this one. I suggest you do the same. -> 我们已经知道<XGParam:StrValue1/!ChosenName/>在哪休养生息，接下来只需要处理点细节问题，找到进入该设施的方式。这是一项风险较大的行动，但如果我们成功，那东西就无处可藏了。我派去执行这项任务的都是顶尖好手，我建议你也这样做。

This is the moment we've been waiting for. -> 我们已做好了彻底清除天选者威胁的准备，估计这会是一场硬仗。变种人可是很记仇的，我们这次的目标又是长老最后的宠物。他们的抵抗应该会很顽强，一定要专注完成目标。这一刻我们已经等了很久了。

Stay sharp, be ready for anything, and take that thing out. -> 我们准备再对长老的宠物天选者发动一次突袭。如果我们能再干掉一个天选者，就能狠狠打击外星人征服我们世界的计划。之前的那次任务并不简单，所以这次也一样。保持警惕，准备应对任何情况，干掉那家伙。
We're making good progress, now we know for sure <XGParam:StrValue1/!ChosenName/> has a facility here and we can start prepping a strike. Unfortunately we still have to find a way in, and seeing how the whole place is underground I'm guessing things are only gonna get more difficult from here on out. -> 我们取得了不错的进展，现在已经确定<XGParam:StrValue1/!ChosenName/>在这儿建造了一个设施，可以准备进攻了。遗憾的是我们尚未找到进去的路，而且这整个地方都是建在地下，看来寻找入口只会加倍困难。
We're making progress against the aliens, and it sounds like we're starting to get the civilians attention in the colonies. It's important that the crew knows people out there need us, and want us to help turn this thing around. They have to know there's a reason to endure all this. -> 我们对抗外星人有了新的进展，而且貌似殖民地的平民们也开始关注我们了。得让船员知道那里的人们需要我们，需要我们改变这一切，这非常重要。他们必须得知道我们忍受这一切背后的伟大理想。

We need to secure the site, remove any hostiles standing in our way, and free the prisoner. -> 我们正去为反抗军执行一个紧急营救行动，线人给了我们VIP的位置，VIP正在该地区中被变种人扣押，我们需要确保该区域的安全，消灭所有挡路的敌人，并解救俘虏。
We're moving to take out a high-security ADVENT installation operating out of this region. Intel from the resistance suggests this facility is conducting research critical to the Avatar project. Once in position, approach the designated target and plant the X4 charges. Once they're armed, move to minimum safe distance and level that facility. -> 我们准备去摧毁该区域一个高机密级别的变种人装置。反抗军告诉我们这个装置与\"化身计划\"的开发有关。一旦你们就位，到达指定区域并安置X4炸药。装好之后，逃到最小安全引爆距离以外，炸毁这个设施。
We're not entirely sure what sort of formal training <XGParam:StrValue1/!FirstName/> had before the invasion hit <XGParam:StrValue0/!CountryName/>, but her time spent as a field medic gives her a leg up on most of the candidates we come across. -> 对于外星人入侵<XGParam:StrValue0/!CountryName/>之前，<XGParam:StrValue1/!FirstName/>受过什么样的正式训练，我们并不清楚，但她在战地救护方面进行过长时间的研究，因此她在我们遇到的大部分候选人当中有一定的优势。

We're not exactly sure. It's organic in nature yet highly magnetized. And it appears to resonate, very faintly, within a specific electromagnetic spectrum.  It is currently unclear how or- -> 我们还无法完全确定，它的本质为有机体却具有高磁性，而且似乎能产生共鸣，非常微弱，频率介于特定的电磁波谱内。目前并不清楚这个现象如何或--
We're not getting any relief from that interference, Commander. Something is throwing off readings out there-the good news is, it's probably slowing ADVENT down too. -> 干扰并没有减弱，指挥官。任务区内有东西让读数居高不下 -- 好消息是，变种人也会受到影响。
We're not going to. Commander, we need to take that thing out while we still can. -> 我们不会束手待毙的。指挥官，我们得在一切无可挽回前摧毁那门加农炮。

We're picking up a steady signal from the transponder, Firebrand is on route to make the pickup. -> 我们收到了发信器传来的稳定信号，红恶魔正在过来的路上。
We're picking up a steady stream of communications coming from a hidden alien comm relay uploading data to the ADVENT network from this region. We have to take advantage of every opportunity to disrupt the aliens' progress on their latest operation, so we're moving in to destroy the relay before they complete the transfer. Don't leave any hostiles standing. -> 我们找到了一个来自外星人通讯中心的稳定的通信信号，中继器隐藏在此区域中，正向变种人网络上传数据。我们必须抓住每次机会，以干扰外星人最新活动进程，所以我们必须在他们结束传输之前摧毁中继器。不要放过任何一个敌人。
We're picking up an inbound ADVENT transport, the aliens are going to try and extract the General from the AO. Don't let them get on board that ship. -> 我们探测到了变种人运输工具的信号，它们想要营救那个将军。别让它们得逞了。

We're moving in to secure the area as quickly as possible. Neutralize all enemy contacts. -> 我们收到一个断断续续的求助信号，就目前来看外星人正在攻打一处反抗军前哨站。这看起来不太好。我们正尽快向那里去保全区域。消灭所有遇到的敌军。

We're ready. -> 一切就绪。
We're seeing heavy civilian casualties, Commander! We have to stop this! -> 指挥官，有大量平民伤亡！我们必须阻止他们！
We're seeking every possible outlet to gain information on the aliens' latest project, and in this case, that means infiltrating one of their facilities to access an exposed terminal connected to their network. Hostile forces will be in position to defend the site, so we'll have to neutralize any threats to lock down the area. Recover whatever you can, we need that data if we're going to stop their progress. -> 我们尝试所有从变种人网络获取信息的可能方式，在这个行动中，你需要侵入敌方设施并接入暴露的终端，连接到他们的网络，敌方武装正在防御该区域，我们需要消除所有威胁并确保该区域的安全。收集所有能得到的数据，如果要阻止他们就必须要那个数据。

We're targeting an ADVENT troop transport that resistance forces managed to disable in this region, the aliens aren't expecting to see us, so this is our chance to seize whatever technology they've got onboard that thing. We're expecting heavy resistance at the site - move in and neutralize all hostile contacts and secure the area. -> 我们的目标是在该区域已经被反抗军瘫痪了的变种人军队运输工具。外星人并不会知道我们的到来，因此我们有机会获得任何我们能取得的技术资料。我们预测在那儿会有大量敌对势力存在--清除所有敌人并保证该区域安全。
We're tracking an errant signal from a malfunctioning ADVENT data vault being moved on one of their transport vehicles in this area. As far as we can tell its carrying data files critical to the project we recently learning about. ADVENT is just as likely to be aware of the malfunction, but recovering that data is the only way we'll slow the progress of their operation. Neutralize all hostile targets and secure the assets. -> 我们正在追踪一个有故障的变种人数据库，它就在这个区域的一个变种人运输载具上。就我们所知，数据库中包含了我们最近了解到的计划的重要数据。变种人好像也意识到了他们的问题，但回收该数据是我们唯一能够拖延他们行动的方法。消灭所有敌方目标并确保东西的安全。

We've been given a prime opportunity to disrupt ADVENT's operations and delay their current plans.

Once you hit the ground, find our target and eliminate him as quickly possible. -> 我们发现了一个打乱变种人行动，拖延他们当前计划的大好机会 -- 它们的一个战地指挥官决定来这附近实地考察 -- 我们要保证他离开的时候被装在裹尸袋里。降落后，找到目标，尽快消灭之。
We've been here before. Brace for transport. -> 我们都用过这玩意儿，准备传送。
We've been keeping an eye on an intermittent signal moving through this area, and we think it's tied to an unprotected terminal on board one of the ADVENT trains. We can't pass up a chance to retrieve their data on the latest alien project, so we're moving on the train. Eliminate all hostile forces with extreme prejudice. If we can seize control of that data, we might have a shot at stopping their progress. -> 我们一直在追踪一个在该地区的断断续续的信号，我们相信这是一辆在该地区变种人列车内一个未被保护的终端发出的。我们不能失去获取最近外星人计划数据的机会，所以我们要进入列车并毫不留情的消灭敌人。如果我们能获得那些数据，我们就有机会阻止他们的行动。
We've been picking unusual readings coming from this area, and our recon team has confirmed that ADVENT is now operating some sort of massive Psionic transmitter nearby. Shen and Tygan agree, if we destroy the transmitter while it's still connected to ADVENT's network, their operations across this entire region could be crippled. -> 我们发现附近的一个市中心下方的隧道内传来了异常读数，侦察队也确认变种人在那里安装了某种巨型的信号发射器。沈和泰根都认为如果我们在它还与变种人网络连接时摧毁它，就能瘫痪它们在该区域内的所有行动。

We've been struggling to maintain long range communications after the recent sabotage by the Chosen. Our covert actions will be delayed by a week. -> 通讯设备被天选者破坏后，我们一直在全力维持长距通讯，但隐秘行动时间还是不得不延长一星期。
We've been tracking a weak ADVENT signal moving through this region, it looks like a data vault - probably stowed aboard one of their trains. Initial analysis suggests the data may be tied to the aliens' latest project, so we're moving in to lock it down. Secure the AO and remove any hostile forces protecting the train, then seize the assets by whatever means necessary. -> 我们在追踪一条路经此地的微弱的变种人信号，好像来自一辆外星人列车上的数据库。初步分析表明该数据库中含有外星人最新行动计划的重要信息，我们得赶去获取它。肃清任务区，消灭所有守卫列车的敌军，然后不惜一切代价取得数据。

We've confirmed that the soldier taken captive during our previous operation is being held within a high-security ADVENT facility not far from your position. If we try to take them back by force, it won't be long before we're totally outnumbered by enemy reinforcements. Our best bet is to go in quietly, drawing as little attention as possible. -> 我们已经确认上次行动中被俘虏的那名士兵正被关押在附近的一个高安全等级的变种人设施内。如果我们试图用武力夺回他，恐怕很快就会抵挡不住源源不断的敌方支援。最好的办法还是悄悄进去，尽可能不引起它们的注意。

We've detected one of the Chosen guarding our intended target, Commander. If we don't clear it out first it's definitely going to get in our way. -> 我们探测到有个天选者在守卫我们的目标，指挥官，如果我们不先排除掉他，他肯定会碍事的。
We've done what we can to honor our fallen soldiers, Commander. It's not much, but it gives our people a chance to pay their respects. -> 我们已经做了我们力所能及的来纪念这些死去的战士们，指挥官。这并不够，但至少给我们提供了一个表达敬意的机会。

We've extracted the VIP's escort. Once we get him patched up, he should be ready to rejoin the fight. -> 我们撤出了VIP的护送人员，等我们治好他的伤，他应该就能投入战斗了。
We've finally got our access point to the stronghold. Once we move in, there won't be any place left for <XGParam:StrValue1/!ChosenName/> to run. This is our chance to end their hunt for good. It will be a great feast! -> 我们终于找到了该要塞的入口。一旦我们进去，<XGParam:StrValue1/!ChosenName/>就无路可逃了。这是我们一劳永逸终结他们的狩猎的大好机会。肯定会是一场大战！
We've found a new route that should get you to the rendezvous point safely. The Lost are still converging on the area so make it fast. -> 我们找到了一条能够让你们安全抵达汇合点的新路线。失魂者依然在往这里聚集，你们快走吧。
We've found another of the Chosen's weaknesses, good work. -> 我们又发现了一个天选者的弱点，干得好。

We've gained some additional intel on the Chosen as a result of our latest action. -> 我们最近的行动使我们获得了有关天选者的额外情报。
We've gone as far as we can, it's time we go through this gateway of theirs and see what the aliens are really hiding on the other side. If our past experiences are any indication, we need to be prepared to throw everything we've got at 'em.  -> 我们已经竭尽所能，是时候走过这道门然后彻底粉碎化身计划了。如果说我们之前的经历对我们有什么启示，那就是做好准备全力一击。
We've got 'em; heading home. -> 我们接到他们了。返航。
We've got a lead on a disabled ADVENT train that was hit by resistance operatives working in this area. There's still the potential to recover valuable technology here, so we're moving to capture whatever we can. We'll need to secure the area and remove any hostile forces still defending the train if we're going to make this work. -> 我们获得线报称有一列被反抗军瘫痪的变种人火车正在该区域。我们还有可能收集到一些有价值的技术情报，因此我们正前往准备获取任何能取得的物资。我们需要保证该区域安全并清除所有防御火车的敌对势力。
We've got a line on another one of their remote turrets, let's take it down. -> 我们又看到了一座遥控炮台，摧毁它吧。
We've got a prime opportunity here to disrupt the aliens' progress on their latest operation. Intel suggests ADVENT is moving a secure data vault through this area on one of their trains, and the information it's carrying is critical to the aliens' efforts. We're moving to secure the train. Eliminate all hostile contacts and recover the assets. -> 我们有了一次搅乱外星人最新行动的绝佳机会。有消息称变种人正通过列车运载一个数据库，该数据库中包含外星人行动的关键信息。我们正赶去肃清该列车。干掉所有遇到的敌兵并回收物资。
We've got a problem. -> 我们遇到一个麻烦。
We've got a shot at hitting the Elders hard, something we haven't tried before. You up for it, Commander? -> 我们有机会让长老尝尝我们的厉害了，而且是以一种我们从未试过的方式。有兴趣么，指挥官？
We've got a situation here. The aliens are taking another run at the Avenger - they've dropped a disruptor spike to keep us on the ground. We've seen this before commander, let's hope they haven't changed their tactics. -> 我们遇到状况了。外星人对复仇者号又有了新的行动 - 他们的刺状干扰器让我们无法起飞。我们之前对付过，指挥官，希望这次他们没有改变战术。
We've got a soldier down, get to 'em before the Chosen do! -> 有士兵倒下了，在天选者接近前赶到他身边！
We've got faint life signs dotting that area...keep your eyes peeled for Lost activity, we've got enough on our hands as it is. -> 该区域内有微弱的生命迹象...留意下有没有失魂者出现，我们现在手头上的麻烦已经够多了。
We've got incoming! -> 有敌人接近！
We've got multiple contacts closing on your position, it's an ambush! Hold your ground! -> 我们探测到有多名敌人正在靠近你的位置，这是场埋伏！坚持住！
We've got no other alerts on the entire SYSTEM- -> 整个系统都没有出现其他警示--
We've got our shot at the Chosen, let's make sure it counts.  -> 天选者已进入射程范围，可不要打偏了。
We've got system failures across the board, Commander! We can't take hits like that! -> 飞船系统故障，指挥官！我们不能再挨上这样的炮击了！
We've got the Chosen in our sights, it's time to take 'em out. -> 我们看见天选者了，是时候干掉他了。
We've got the Chosen on the run! -> 我们把天选者打跑了！
We've got the Chosen right where we want 'em, it's time to strike. -> 天选者已进入预定伏击位置，该出击了。
We've got the package, time to get everyone else out. -> 我们已获取目标，是时候把大家撤出来了。
We've got the schematics, and our equipment is ready to begin assembly, Commander. Just give the word and we'll build the Skull Jack. -> 根据手头的图纸，我们可以准备开始组装了，指挥官。我们将制造头颅接入器，就等你的一声令下了。

We've got what we came for, let's get clear of the area. -> 我们得到了要的东西，让我们离开这里吧。
We've gotta get that soldier some help before they bleed out. Stabilize them with a medikit, or call in an EVAC and carry 'em to the extraction point. They won't last much longer without support. -> 我们必须在他们流血身亡之前救治他们。 快点用急救包治疗他们， 或者请求撤离然后带他们去撤离点，再不救他们就晚了。
We've gotten word that the aliens have been conducting sweeps of this region, searching for some sort of data vault stolen during a previous resistance raid. If it's valuable enough that they've got troops out looking for it, then it sounds like the perfect target for us to seize control of. We're heading in to secure the area and locate the vault. Eliminate all hostile contacts. -> 我们得到消息，外星人正对这个区域进行清扫行动，寻找之前被反抗军偷走的数据库。这个数据库肯定很重要，所以他们才会派出军队寻找，而这也是我们应该全力获取的目标。我们要前去肃清那个区域并找到数据库。消灭所有遇到的敌人。
We've had our suspicions, but before now we've never had the resources to investigate the possibility of clandestine ADVENT facilities built up outside the cities centers. Now that we've gotten word of this black site, I have to admit, I'm worried about what we might find. They could be doing anything in there.  -> 我们有我们的疑虑，但是以前我们没有任何资源可以调查市中心外秘密建立的变种人设施。既然我们已经得到了黑地的一些消息，我不得不承认，我很担心我们进去后会看到什么。在那里他们什么事情都干得出来。
We've had the troops digging through scrap piles and looting corpses, and at this point, it's safe to assume they're on constant vigil for anything we could use to improve our gear. All the raw materials in the world won't mean much if I can't find a use for them, but I think this modular weapon system is a good start. Having pushed our existing designs about as far as I thought possible, the integration of a few key alien components provided the much needed stability we've been looking for. With these modifications in place, we should be able to attach larger upgrades for even more firepower. The troops will like that. L. Shen. -> 我们已经叫军队去挖垃圾并翻找尸体，可以说他们已经把能拿来当武器的东西都找到了。除非我能找到它的使用方法，否则就算找到所有的原材料也没什么用。不过我认为这个模组武器系统会有帮助。尽一切可能发展我们现在的设计，再结合一些关键外星科技就能使我们的发明稳定下来。改进之后我们应该就可以升级军火。军队会很高兴的。莉莉·沈。
We've honed our skills in developing and manufacturing explosive ordinance mirroring that used in the aliens' own weaponry. Now we can use those skills to upgrade our entire aresenal of explosives using the latest technology. -> 经过长期努力，我们在仿制外星爆炸物方面已经积累了相当的经验，现在我们可以用这些技术来为爆炸类兵器进行全面革新。
We've knocked out the alien distress signal, looks like the skies are quiet. -> 我们关闭了外星人的求救信号，天空看起来又安静了。
We've located one of the Factions' headquarters, now we just need to establish contact with the region to move in. -> 我们已经定位了反抗军派系之一的总部，接下来只要与该区域取得联系就能去那里拜访了。
We've located the Elders' Hunter actively working in this region, Commander. -> 我们发现长老的猎手在该区域出没，指挥官。
We've locked in the coordinates Shen and Tygan pulled from the Codex, Commander, but we'll have to make contact with the local resistance cell before we can move to investigate the site. -> 指挥官，我们已经定位了沈和泰根从原典中取得的坐标，不过在我们进去调查之前，我们需要先同当地反抗军组织取得联系。

We've lost possession of the ADVENT specimen - retrieve it ASAP - we can't let them take control of this situation! -> 我们丢失了变种人样本的掌控权。马上夺回来，我们不允许他们控制局面！
We've lost possession of the canister. Retrieve it on the double. We can't let the aliens get the upper hand here. -> 我们失去了对容器的掌控权。赶紧抢回来。我们绝不能让外星人占得上风。
We've lost power! We're goin' down fast! -> 我们失去了动力！正在快速下坠！

We've lost the VIP, Commander, we should get our people to the extraction point and move on. -> VIP死了，指挥官，我们应该让队员们到撤离点去，该回家了。
We've made contact with resistance forces, Commander, and they've already got something they could use our help with. -> 我们已经和反抗军势力联络了，指挥官，他们有一些需要我们帮助的事情。
We've made initial contact with the resistance operatives working this area, Commander. They're going show us how to get into the alien Forge facility. -> 我们已经和这个地区的反抗军成员有了初步联络，指挥官。他们会告诉我们如何进入外星人锻造设施。
We've managed to salvage a variety of standard infantry small arms; this is a specialized weapon for close range engagement. While decidedly inferior to ADVENT magnetic technology, it can at least be upgraded using additional weapons salvage once we perfect modular weapon technology. -> 我们已经成功回收各式各样的标准步兵小型军火；这是专为近距离作战设计的武器。虽然明显比不上变种人的磁能技术，一旦我们完善了模组化武器技术，它至少能使用额外收集来的武器进行升级。

While decidedly inferior to ADVENT magnetic technology, it can at least be upgraded using additional weapons salvage once we perfect modular weapon technology. -> 我们已经成功获得了一些不同的标准步兵小型武器了，这是最基本的武器，类似二十年前使用的步枪。虽然这些武器当然比起变种人磁能技术的武器差得多，但它们在标准技术研究完成后，至少可以用额外的武器碎片进行升级。
We've only got one more operative on the ground, we need to get them out of there! -> 地面上只剩一个特工了，我们得接他离开这里！
We've picked up a lull in their forces, it looks like they're running out of reinforcements. Let's get moving before that changes.  -> 我们探测到它们的兵力缩减了，看来它们暂时不会派增援过来了。在它们改变主意前尽快完成任务吧。
We've pinpointed an exposed access point on the ADVENT network that we could use to intercept critical data on the aliens' latest operation, but the terminal is somewhere inside one of their facilities in this area. We don't get too many opportunities like this, so we're moving in to hack that workstation. Eliminate any hostile contacts and secure the surrounding area, recover whatever you can. We need that data if we're going to stop their progress -> 我们已经查明一个暴露的变种人网络接入点，我们可以利用此来收集一些关于外星人最近行动的关键数据，但终端在该地区的敌方设施内部。我们不可能得到太多像这样的机会，所以我们要过去侵入工作站的终端，你得消灭所有敌人并确保该区域的安全，收集一切可能的数据，我们需要这些来阻止他们的行动。
We've pinpointed the location of an ADVENT facility housing the flight system component Shen needs. Infiltrate the site, secure the target, and get back to the ship before the aliens realize what we've done. -> 我们已经锁定变种人设施的地点了，里面有沈需要的飞行系统零件。侵入那个地点，保护目标并且在外星人发觉之前回到船上。

We've recovered another crucial piece of information about the Chosen. -> 我们又获得了一则有关天选者的重要情报。
We've recovered enough of the ADVENT armor to begin repurposing the outer plates into something better suited to our soldiers. The material itself seems to be the same as what the aliens utilized throughout the Avenger's hull, an extremely durable substance with an unusual ambient magnetic property. As an armor component, the magnetic fields surrounding these plates will actually provide additional protection against magnetic-based weaponry, most notably the gauss weaponry commonly equipped by ADVENT. R. Tygan. -> 我们研究了很多变种人的护甲来把我们的护甲变得更适合自己的士兵使用。材料似乎和外星人用在复仇者号外壳的材料相同，都很耐用且内部带有磁性。作为护甲的一部分，它的磁性会保护使用者免受磁力兵器的伤害，特别是变种人常用的高斯武器。理查德·泰根。
We've recovered the VIP's escort. We'll get her patched up and ready to redeploy into the field. -> 我们救下了VIP的护送人员。我们这就给她包扎一下，让她重返战场。
We've run across the ADVENT turrets in a variety of places, mainly near the security checkpoints and other areas they're trying to lock down. Now that we've finally gotten a chance to pull one apart, I can say with certainty that the turrets are operating entirely on their own, with no outside controller or remote direction given.\n\nAs much as I'd like to test the targeting sensors, Central and Dr. Tygan have both expressed their concerns about test-firing the system before we know how it discerns between friendly and hostile targets. Considering how close the aliens' position these things to civilian occupied areas, the target recognition software must be incredibly accurate, or incredibly basic. I wouldn't be all that surprised if the aliens were just flipping the switch and setting these loose on anyone caught in the firing radius. I'll have to see about setting up some sort of test environment. L. Shen. -> 我们已经在很多地方遭遇过变种人炮塔了，主要是在保全检查站以及其它他们想要控制的区域。现在我们终于获得了一个分解其构造的机会，我很确定这些炮塔都是全自动运作的，没有外部的控制器或是远程指令。\n\n我想测试它们的瞄准传感器，军事官和泰根博士都不赞成在搞清楚它们如何分清敌我前进行测试。考虑到外星人将其部署的位置离平民居住区非常靠近，这个目标识别软件一定是极为精准，或是极度基础的。如果外星人只是开个开关，就让它无差别的对火力范围内一切生物开火的话，我也不会特别惊讶。我会在建立起合适的测试环境后来弄清楚这点的。莉莉·沈。
We've seen the aliens using a variety of exotic ammunition in their weapons. Using elerium cores we've recovered from the battlefield, we could develop new ammo types of our own that will likely be more potent than any of our our current munitions. -> 我们已经看到外星人在自己的武器上配置了大量特殊弹药。使用从战场上回收的超柚核心，我们可以研发一种我们自己的新弹药，这将会比我们之前的所有传统弹药更加强力。
We've spent a lot of time outfitting our troops, Commander. They're ready to fight. If we get a chance to strike first, I say we take it. -> 我们已经花了很长时间装备我们的军队，指挥官。他们已经做好了出战准备。如果我们有能够先行进攻的机会就不应该放弃。
We've spotted the Chosen, get ready to fight! -> 我们被天选者发现了，准备战斗！
We've taken out everything they had targeting the ship, we're clear to take off. Excellent work, Commander.  -> 我们已经摧毁了敌人所有的对飞船用武器，可以起飞了。干得太漂亮了，指挥官。
We've taken some heavy losses out there, Commander, it might be better to abort the mission than take any further risks. -> 我们损失惨重，指挥官，或许应该在把整个小队都搭上前中止任务。
We've traced the location of an ADVENT data vault through their network to a facility situated in this region. As far as we can tell its storing data critical to the aliens' latest operation. We're moving in to seize control of the assets, but security forces in the area won't make it easy on us. Eliminate all targets and capture whatever you can. -> 我们通过变种人网络追踪到了他们位于本区域设施点内的一个数据库。我们发现，这个数据库中存储了外星人最新行动的关键数据内容。我们必须赶去获得该数据，但守卫的敌军是不会让我们轻易得手的。干掉所有的目标并获取数据。
We've won but a battle- -> 我们只是打赢了一场战斗-
We've yet to discover the aliens' means of forging the alloy materials used throughout their structures and equipment. However, the alloy fragments have proven to be a more than effective projectile in initial testing when properly contained. -> 我们已经发现了外星人用在建筑和装备上的合金材料的锻造方法。然而在最初的测试中，合金碎片只有在相当正确的方法控制下才能成为一个有效的攻击手段。
We, the Skirmishers, were created by the false gods of this world to serve and die as their puppets. We retain all that we were and more, and our prowess in battle serves us well in our cause. In close combat, none can stand opposed to us. -> 我们散兵是被这个世界的伪神当成为他们服侍的傀儡创造出来的。我们抛去了过去的身份和义务，而我们的战斗能力让我们拥有了反抗长老的资本。在近身战中，我们是无敌的。

Welcome Commander -> 欢迎，指挥官。
Welcome back, Commander. I wanted to speak to you about our current fleet of Interceptors. It's crucial that we keep several of these aircraft on high alert - we'll need them to intercept any future alien contacts, and it's likely we'll suffer some losses in the process. To help prevent that, you have the option of modifying the interceptor's weapon loadouts from the hangar interface. -> 欢迎回来，指挥官。我想跟您谈谈关于我们目前拦截机的事，让数架拦截机保持在警备状态是非常重要的--我们在任何外星人接触中都会需要用到它们进行拦截，而且有可能在这个过程中失去其中几架。为了防止那样的情况发生，您可以在机库接口选择变更拦截机的武器装备。
Welcome back...Commander. -> 欢迎回来...指挥官。

Welcome to XCOM HQ, Commander. -> 欢迎来到XCOM总部，指挥官。
Welcome to the Proving Grounds, Commander. It seemed like good idea to isolate some of our more experimental concepts, especially when it comes to weapons development. -> 欢迎来到试验场，指挥官。把我们一些实验性概念单独拿出来试验是个好主意，尤其是在武器方面。

Well done. Readings are returning to normal...well, mostly normal.  -> 好极了，读数正在恢复正常...恩...基本正常。
Well done. We struck a major blow for the Resistance and humanity today. The Elders aren't gods and neither are their pets. Time to spread the word. -> 干得好，今天我们为反抗军和人类沉重打击了外星人。长老不是什么神，他们的孩子也不是。是时候把消息传出去了。
Well done. With the Chosen down, the path to the Elders is clear. Time to make them pay. -> 干得漂亮。没有了天选者，长老也就没有了保镖。是时候找他们算账了。
Well met XCOM. You have proven your worth against my brothers. Now your real test begins. -> 别来无恙，XCOM。你们击败了我的兄弟，证明了自己的能力。现在，你们真正的考验开始了。
Well we better make sure we have the right key before we try again. I would hate for this to occur on something "organic." -> 那么我们最好在第二次尝试前，确保我们拿到了正确的钥匙，我讨厌这种不可捉摸的所谓的\"有机\"。

When we first brought this thing in, some of the troops were still adamant that once we opened it up, we'd find a Sectoid or worse at the helm. Fortunately, our precautions weren't necessary; there's nothing organic inside, no "operator" providing physical directions. Unless they're triggering it remotely, all indications point to this \"Sectopod\" being an entirely autonomous weapon, operating according to the parameters of its system programming. This is exactly the sort of weapon that would have raised eyebrows in the past. I know dad would have been apprehensive about arming a robot and sending it on its way. It's pretty clear at this point the aliens aren't bound by any moral or ethical obligations; if it's efficient and destructive, they seem to have no problem setting it loose on us. L. Shen. -> 当我们首次将那东西带进来时，一些军人依旧十分坚信我们将其打开之后会找到一个灰人或是更糟的东西。幸运的是，我们的预防措施没派上用场，其内部没有任何生命体，没有操作员提供物理的指令。除非他们是远程触发的，所有的迹象都证明这个\"破坏者\"完全是个自动化武器，完全是依靠系统编程的参数来运作的。在过去这绝对是一个能让人挑眉的武器。我知道我父亲绝对会对给一个机器人如此火力产生忧虑。但显然外星人没有这种道德上的束缚和伦理的限制，只要这个机器足够有效率和毁灭性，他们就会毫不在意地将其用于战场上。莉莉·沈。

While most of my involvement in the chip development process was on the theoretical side, I can't help but feel some degree of responsibility for the final product as we see it in use today. When intently focused on a singular aspect of a project, in my case, countering the body's rejection of the implanted chip, sometimes it's easy to avoid seeing the bigger picture.

In any case, I'll continue to do my best to prove my worth. -> 大多船员都很热情友好，但我总觉得沈博士对我的存在内心怀有极大的不信任感。尽管她表面上语言与他人无异，但能让人感觉出带有对指挥官的尊敬，还有并非真正想与我共事的愿望。所以无论如何，我都会继续努力来证明我的价值的。

With limited resources available to outfit our troops, up until now they've had to make do with whatever makeshift armor Shen managed to piece together for them from various scrap materials. Relying on methods that might otherwise seem outdated, we've developed a means of producing a multilayered nanofiber weave capable of withstanding direct impacts as well as any traditional armor, without the added weight. Our troops will still have to exercise caution; even the nanofiber has its limits - it may be best suited to our forces who rely on agility over pure stopping power. In any case, I imagine our soldiers will be pleased to see any improvements over their current equipment. R. Tygan. -> 我们用来制作军备的资源有限，直到现在我们的军队都还只能穿着沈用各种零件拼成的临时护甲。我们依靠或许有些落后的方式研制出了一种制造多层纳米织物，使之能够像以前的护甲一样承受直接打击，并且不会增加重量。我们的军队仍需多加小心：纳米纤维也有它的局限性，或许它更适合机动性的部队。不管怎样，我想对于当下这些装备的任何改进都会让我们的士兵欢呼雀跃。理查德·泰根。
With limited tactical resources, XCOM has to rely on stealth to gain the upper hand on our enemies. Most operations (with the exception of VIP Rescues and Retaliation missions) begin with the XCOM squad in concealment. By avoiding the enemy's detection radius, XCOM can remain concealed indefinitely. However, most tactical objectives dictate that enemy forces be engaged and eliminated, so concealment should primarily be used to position for ambushes. -> 由于战术资源有限，XCOM不得不仰仗隐形技术克敌制胜。大多数行动（除去VIP救援与报复任务）在开始时，XCOM小队都会选择隐形，且只要不被敌方探测发现，隐形效果可以一直持续。考虑到大部分任务在执行过程中都难免要与敌方交战，或需要消灭敌人，隐形应首要用来安排伏击。
With little time to prepare, we were forced to conduct an extremely invasive procedure on the Commander in order remove what appeared to be an implant carefully enmeshed within the occipital lobe. Although all indications were that the device was not designed for removal, concerns as to the Commander's potential longevity, and the risk of possible remote manipulation by the aliens, left us with little alternative.\n\nDespite my concerns, the Commander has so far felt no lasting effects from the procedure and appears to be recovering ahead of expectations. As for the chip itself, my initial findings are alarming, to say the least. The device is Psionically-driven by the latent energy of the subject's brain, in this case, the Commander. More importantly, it appears the device functions as both a transmitter and receiver, relaying information via some form of Psionic link.\n\nEven after removal, I've had to shield the device to contain the residual Psionic fields surrounding the implant itself, for fear of what it might be capable of. If my current theory is correct, the Commander may have played a more important role in ADVENT's operations than we could have possibly imagined. R. Tygan. -> 由于时间紧迫，我们不得不对指挥官的治疗采用一种极度侵害性的手段，以此来移除一枚陷入在枕骨脑叶处的植入物。虽然一切症状都表明该植入物难以移除，但考虑到指挥官的身体健康，以及被外星人远程操控的可能性，我们没有什么选择的余地。\n\n尽管我很担心，但指挥官目前并没有表现出有什么后遗症，并且他的恢复也超出了预期。而关于芯片本身，我最开始的发现是令人担忧的。这个设备是由受体大脑潜在能量在灵能层面控制的，在这个案例，受体便是指挥官。更重要的是，这设备在功能上是一个收发器，通过灵能连接来传送信息。\n\n即便是在移除后，我也必须屏蔽这个设备来控制在这个植入物四周剩余的灵能力场，这是担心它潜在的危险性。如果我目前的理论正确的话，指挥官可能已经在变种人的行动中扮演了一个重要的角色。理查德·泰根。

With one exception. It is good to see you again. In the days since your capture I have done all I can to aid the resistance from the inside. It was these resistance operatives that provided the intel leading to your recent extraction. As of now, resistance forces are currently somewhat... disorganized. If we are to defeat ADVENT and their alien masters, you must change this before it is too late. -> 只有一个例外。真高兴再次见到你。在你被俘的日子里，我从内部做了所有能做的来帮助抵抗网络。我们的努力也为最近解救你的行动提供了信息。 现在，反抗军还有些...群龙无首。如果我们要打败变种人和他们的外星人主人，你必须在一切还来得及的时候...扭转乾坤。
With one exception. It is good to see you again. In the days since your capture I've done all I can to aid the resistance network from the inside. Our efforts resulted in the information leading to your recent extraction. There were, however, unintended consequences. Directly following your release, there has been a significant increase in ADVENT military operations. Our unwelcome guests are up to something. -> 只有一个例外。真高兴再次见到你。在你被俘获的日子里，我从从内部做了所有能做的来帮助反抗军网络。我们的努力也为最近解救你的行动提供了信息。不过，也造成了一些意料之外的后果。在你被释放后，变种人军队的行动次数有了显著增加。那些不受欢迎的客人们显然有什么目的。
With our mastery of ADVENT's core weapons technology, we can now develop specialized weapon systems using the alien technology to improve on power storage and consumption, projectile path fidelity, and penetrative force over greater distances. We may be able to develop a sniper rifle and cannon variant based on our newly learned Magentic Weapons technology. -> 由于掌握了变种人武器的核心技术，我们现在可以使用外星技术开发更多的特殊武器系统来改善能量储备和消耗，远距离弹道的精准度以及穿透力。我们或许能够根据最新研究出的磁力武器技术制造一种狙击步枪和变体加农炮。
With our success, comes the opportunity for you to assign us new orders, Commander. -> 我们的成功为你创造了全新的战机，指挥官。
With our supply of Elerium crystals limited by what our soldiers can recover in the field, I've been hesitant to recommend we commit them to any one project exclusively. However, in the wake of recent events, it seems like we need to work on developing an armor suit exceeding the durability and toughness of any of our previous designs. In order to do that, we've integrated an Elerium-based power cell into one our heavier frames. With the Elerium's incredible energy throughput, the suit can now support the use a self-contained force field. In the simplest of terms, we've mirrored the technologies most commonly used by the aliens in the defense of their UFOs, and fused them with a platform our troops can deploy in the field. I expect great things from this unit. L. Shen. -> 由于我们只能从战场上缴获超铀水晶，本想我斗胆提议将它们全都用于一个项目上。然而，就近来的几个事件看，我们目前的当务之急就是开发出远超当前水准的护甲。为此，我们尝试将超铀动力电池嵌入重型护甲中。有了超铀水晶的能量，该护甲能够生成自我防护力场。也就是说，我们成功复制了外星人普遍用于他们的幽浮中的防御系统，将其应用在实战中。莉莉·沈
With so many of your soldiers having been taken captive, how long do you suppose it will be before one of them reveals your secrets, Commander? -> 你有那么多士兵被俘虏，好好想想他们还能保守你的秘密多久吧，指挥官。

With the information the Chosen extracted from our soldier, they'll be closer than ever to finding you, Commander.  -> 有了从我们士兵大脑中提取到的信息，天选者离抓到你又近了一步，指挥官。
With the inherent difficulties in trying to forge or manipulate the alien alloys we've recovered from the field, our thought process as to how this material could be used to our advantage turned towards some of our more traditional, rudimentary weapons designs. In containing a small cluster of alloy fragments within a highly-energized magnetic field, we found it is possible to discharge the cluster using a plasma pulse of varying intensity. The overall design is akin to that of a shotgun, although the result comes more from our inability to form proper projectiles than it does from our desire to generate this particular outcome. Having seen firsthand some of the recent alien forces our troops have been dealing with, I have no doubts they'll still find this new design appealing for its overall stopping power. R. Tygan. -> 将从战场上回收的外星合金改造以及锻造有其固有的困难，我们一直在想如何将这种材料用在对我们有利的更为传统和基础的武器上面。在带有高能的磁力场内加入一小部分的合金碎片时，我们发现我们可以通过使用一个不同频率的磁力脉冲来使其放电。整体设计和散弹枪类似，虽然这并非我们的预想设计，而是由于我们无法制作合适的弹药才造成了这种特殊的伤害效果。在亲身观察了一些我们部队最近对抗的外星势力后，我敢肯定敌人一定会见识到这个新设计的威力。理查德·泰根。
With the loss of this facility, there can be no question that the aliens work has suffered a substantial blow. We must now pursue them to the end, Commander.  -> 失去设施后，毫无疑问外星人的工作遭到了重创。我们现在得给他们致命一击了，指挥官。
With the number of mechanized units ADVENT has available to throw at us, developing munitions capable of disabling them should be one of our higher priorities. Tygan suggested we look into disrupting their core operating system, and I agree, it's a good place to start. -> 变种人对我们所派遣的机械单位数量庞大，因此开发能够瘫痪它们的弹药是我们的首要目标。泰根建议我们专注于干扰它们的核心运作系统，我也同意这点，这是一个不错的开始。

With the variety of environments our forces are currently engaging the enemy in, we need to give them every opportunity to gain a tactical advantage in the field. With that in mind, our latest armor prototype incorporates a basic powered-ascent mechanism capable of propelling the wearer to heights of over 10m with high levels of stability. The suit utilizes a number of micro-servo motors operating in sequence to aid in distributing the load throughout the armor, with the added side-effect of enhanced reflexes provided to the wearer. Although Central has made vague references to the previous science officer serving XCOM, he doesn't seem interested in discussing her efforts with me directly. I'm guessing the grapple design was something she created in collaboration with dad before XCOM fell. L. Shen. -> 我们士兵目前与敌人作战面临着各式各样的环境，我们需要给予他们在战场上获得优势的任何机会。考虑到这一点，我们最新的护甲原型包含了一个基础能量提升装置，该装置能够以高稳定性把穿戴者推进到超过10米的高度。护甲利用大量依次运转的微型控制马达来帮助分散整个护甲的载荷，给穿戴者提供额外加强的反射副作用。尽管军事官对前XCOM科学官员只模糊地提及，看上去他似乎并不是很想直接和我讨论她所做的努力。我只能假设爪钩的设计是她在XCOM倒台前和父亲共同合作完成的。莉莉·沈
With the variety of hostile forces our soldiers are tasked with facing, it seems only logical to provide them with varying alternative means of engaging the enemy, in this case, from a much greater range than previously thought possible. By focusing the standard plasma bolt through a series of modulating rings, a single, powerful shot capable of devastating targets at extreme range can be produced. As is typically the case, the limitations of our environment preclude us from fully testing the bounds of these new plasma-based sniper rifles outside of a simulated environment. Regardless, I'm sure our troops will be eager to find these new limits on their own in the field, and I expect to hear of their exploits for some time to come. R. Tygan. -> 我们的士兵在执行任务时会遇上各种各种的敌对势力，看来有必要研制出多种超出预想范围的与敌交战的武器。通过把研究重点放在由一系列调制环组合在一起的电浆上，我们研制出了一种拥有无敌射程能够一击致命的武器。环境的局限限制了我们无法抛开拟真环境彻彻底底地测试这些基于电浆的新型狙击步枪。无论如何，我确信战士们正跃跃欲试想上战场，自己发现武器的极限。我也期待不久以后听到他们显赫的战绩。理查德·泰根。
With their freedom, they accepted a new path and sacrificed all that they had. Vox Tala for Ten! -> 他们拥有了自由后，接受了一条值得他们献出生命的全新道路。霍斯塔拉佛顿！

With time set aside to further analyze the data fragments leftover from our initial Codex experiment, I've finally managed to crack their code - and the resulting data is perhaps more valuable, and shocking, than I had expected. I understand now why the Codex was willing to sacrifice itself to protect this information.\n\nIn the shadows, the alien overseers, known to us as the "Elders," have continued to work in secret since the very beginnings of ADVENT. Although Central Officer Bradford tells me that no one has seen an Elder in the flesh for over a decade, we continue to see monuments in their likeness throughout the city centers. This is because they never left: they simply fell into the shadows, focusing their efforts on a more dire concern - the Elders are dying.\n\nAmong the diverse and widely varied alien specimens we've encountered, the Elders are uniquely afflicted by some form of rapid muscular degeneration. Their physical forms are no longer capable of containing the Psionic energy that is the Elders' lifeblood. Just as we've encountered these unique alien species in the field, at some point in the past, the Elders encountered them as well - and used them in an attempt to cure this plague among their own kind. Unfortunately for them, and for us, it seems they've never found this cure, and now it appears they are looking to use humanity as their next candidate. R. Tygan. -> 有了充足的时间来研究第一次原典实验的资料，我终于破解了他们的代码-而得出来的数据可能比我想象更加珍贵，并且惊人。我现在明白为什么原典愿意牺牲自己来保护这个信息了。\n\n在黑暗中，外星人监工，也就是我们俗称的\"长老\"，在变种人开始之际就一直秘密工作至今。尽管军事中心长官布拉德福德说过去十年都没有人亲眼见过任何一位长老，但我们在城市中心到处都可以看见类似他们的遗址。这是因为他们从未离开过，只是躲在黑暗之中，专注于解决一个更迫在眉睫的问题 - 长老们正在消亡。\n\n在我们遇到过的这么多外星物种中，只有长老有一种肌肉迅速萎缩的问题。他们的身体再也没有灵能能量，但这是他们的命根子。正如我们曾经遇到过外星人一般，长老们以前也曾遇到过他们，并尝试用他们来治愈自己的疾病。不幸的是，他们似乎从没找到过治愈方法，而且正打算把人类当做下一种实验人选。理查德·泰根。

Within the stasis suit recovered from the ADVENT \"Forge\" facility, we are detecting a humanoid organism of some kind. A new type of ADVENT soldier? An alien being heretofore unseen? Considering the level of security in place to protect this asset, it is surely important to the aliens, though it will take a thorough analysis to discover their ultimate intentions for it. -> 在我们从变种人锻造厂设施中回收的静滞护甲部件，发现了某种人形器官组织。难道是一种新型的变种人士兵？还是前所未见的外星生物？从保护着这个部件的安保等级来看，它对于外星人来说肯定很重要，不过还要通过彻底的分析才能弄清楚这个部件的最终用途。
Without a Training Center, we're wasting a valuable opportunity to take advantage of the bonds our soldiers have formed in combat. If we can spare the resources, we should consider building the facility ASAP, Commander. -> 没有训练中心，我们就白白浪费了利用我们的士兵在战斗中结成的这份深厚情谊的机会。如果我们能腾出足够的资源，就应该立刻建造这样一个设施，指挥官。
